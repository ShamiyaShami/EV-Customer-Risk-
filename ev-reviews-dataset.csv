We all checked the bike's capacity to be 150 km's ( for 1 full charge). now its given only 80 who the hell wants to pay 1 lakh for just 80 km's. We don't need max speed for 70 km. Just 40 km/hr. is more than enough. For better safety. How many accidents need to happen . Worst experience if you expect me to say. Felt cheated.,TVS iQube,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
Performance is very poor on this bike. The charging problem is a very big thing. Worth money. Don't spend the money on this bike. My bike is standing in the service center of tvs iqube for a long time. I am very disappointed. Nobody can hear me because I purchased this bike. I want to sell this bike as soon as possible.,TVS iQube,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"I purchased this in April 2022 and the sales staff was clueless about the new vehicle launch in May 2022. I asked specifically if there is a new model coming but they had no idea.
The scooter is well built and has good features but compared to other ev scooters, it lacks a lot. The most important lacking is its range. The offered range is 75 km/charge but the real range in eco mode is approx 50km. It's a huge setback considering there are models in other brands which cost the same but offer a better range. I would advise anybody looking to buy this vehicle to first consult with existing owners.",TVS iQube,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,3
If any issues come in scooty parts not available at service centre & waiting time of part approximately 2 to 3 month come. I had bought this scooty & I show the service centre many of scooty come many problems & machine says the part is not available right now at service centre & part not provide tvs company waiting time from the company side of parts 2-3 month.,TVS iQube,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Don't buy this vehicle unless you have a near by tvs iqube service center. You will not get service in any other tvs service centers and there is not many service centers over the country. And you will lose your warranty benefits for any delay in servicing the vehicle.
Once you braked the vehicle in a traffic signal, there is delay in releasing the break and moving the bike.",TVS iQube,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"First 7k kms no issues.
Later rear wheel had a bend had to wait for nearly 3 months to get the entire engine assembly replaced as only the rim cannot be removed.
After that rode for 400 kms bike suddenly stopped. Called road side assistance was informed as the bike is more than 1 year they would charge 1600 rs for mere 4 kms, took my bike myself was informed the electric coil is burnt and will not be covered under warranty fought again and was informed that it would be done in warranty. Now the bike is in service center for more than 20 days.",TVS iQube,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"The tvs iqube is supposed to be a game changer for tvs in its ev debut but sadly it is let down by step motherly treatment by tvs itself.
Buying was problematic as tvs as chosen only 4-5 showrooms in all of bangalore to sell iqube. For some reason, showrooms are not enthusiastic about giving test ride, following up, picking calls etc. All the push needs to come from the customer side till they get vehicle delivery. Looks like tvs itself in not eager about selling iqube in big numbers.
The iqube rides very well in city conditions and like a very conventional scooter minus the petrol engine noise and vibrations. No complaints there. No hassles with pillion rider either.
Build quality is not great ..Plastic feel throughout and not the nice kind as well. Gaps between panels are clearly visible. The key fob is a prime example of giving flashiness the upper hand over quality. Mine simply split into two after a few days.
Charging time takes 6-7 hours for 10% to 100% and gives upto 75km riding distance. Good for short distance rides. Charger price is extra, which is plain dumb considering every ev should have a charger in its package. The most cheapest electronic product ships with a charger and tvs chose not to. Clearly the accessory pays more gimmick. Also charging point needs a good earthing presence else vehicle cannot be charged. You will not find this mentioned in showroom.
Vehicle maintenance is not much, just keep tires inflated and use water to clean and that's all it takes.
But the onus is on the owner to keep the vehicle problem-free because iqube service centers are very few and you cannot get it repaired in local garages. You are at the mercy of the tvs service center which can repair it. Tvs having so much local presence already should have at least ensured that iqube can be repaired at any service center. Again this feels deliberate. My nearest service center for iqube is nearly 15 km away but there are more than 8 tvs service centers on the way which do not deal with iqube. Also spares are not compatible with any of their other products.
Another thing is that tvs itself seems perplexed with many of the random things that the scooter does. My vehicle shows up with a ""close throttle warning"" at starting and tvs has not been able to tell why that comes and what the solution is. The only so called solution is to twist the throttle and leave it and hope the warning goes away. Clearly the sensor calibration is what the issue is but they want customer to change the way they drive to solve their problem. I have heard another user say sometimes the battery indicator shows 0% even if there is enough charge and need to restart the vehicle.
Pros:
- decent ev for someone whose daily travel is 50km and has charging facilities at home.
- very good motor. Zippy, zero noise, responsive.
- great handling and suspension and good ground clearance.
- not complicated to use at all even with lots of electronic features.
- easy to maintain.
Cons:
- reliability - range anxiety of ev aside, you never know which sensor might get knocked off on the iqube and the vehicle gets bricked (keep towing services number handy). Tvs should do more customer interaction to know the regular problems faced by users and only then they can solve.
- serviceability is poor. Customer service almost has no knowledge of the scooter working and their only response is to ask the service center to call you.
- takes way to long to charge.
- there is no concept of software upgrade. Awful app.
There is a lot of work for tvs to do with iqube if it wants to be considered a serious ev player. Otherwise, this model will just be a footnote in the ev revolution.",TVS iQube,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,3
"I brought iqube in march 2021 used for about 1400 kms and the motor is dead, The vehicle was dropped at prn motors and its been 25 days now and still the replacement is not done, the display is a waste in the bike, Maps don't work, at least clock I expected and that too is not working. Totally I wasted on such a waste bike. Please don't buy ev scooters with motor in wheel its always a headache.",TVS iQube,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Buying experience - Chennai on road price is 115580/- but they are charging hefty amount on charger cable. Simple charger cable with industrial socket they have priced it as Rs.8260 which should be priced only Rs.2000/- to Rs.3000/-. Tvs has maintained vehicle price equal to competitor but huge margin in chargers and accessories.
Ride comfort with pillion is good and it can be used only for fixed distance usage, like only commuting to office and back to home.
When 100% charged vehicle pick up is good and top speed achieved under power mode 84 km/h, in eco mode top speed is only 52 kmh. But when the power is at less than 70%, eco mode top speed is 44 to 46 km/h only. As per my experience under combination eco & power mode 68% and 32% respectively, the range achieved is 71.9 km with balance 9% charge which shows distance to empty is 7km so approx. total range is 78.9 km. The above range is with regenerative option but we could not see how much regenerative power generated in %, app do not provide any data
Very poor app design and bt connectivity issue continues and reports are not generated for a selected period.
Unnecessarily head light is permanently ""on"", even thought there is one drl, horn sound is worst and not good. They should provide ntorq horn which is louder and good.
Charging time is huge and it takes 6 hours to charge from 9% to 100%, tvs should come out with replaceable battery at least for the under seat battery so we can buy one spare battery and we can use it as reserve power back up option.
The app should provide the details for every trip how much power % consumed and while charging it should provide how much units consumed for every charge
Servicing and maintenance experience not able to comment we have wait and watch, tvs should provide improvements as stated above once they fix the issue to all existing customers especially removable battery option.",TVS iQube,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,3
"Hello,
I purchased tvs iqube in march 2021, it has run 3000 km for 3 months and now there are many problems related to the speed, motor and several other problems. Full battery charging takes 6-7 hours, not satisfied by its performance, also still there are no proper service stations setup to solve the problems. Especially the service station at ramurthinagar, bangalore is very horrible. They don't even respond to our problems.",TVS iQube,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,2
"I have used jupiter and activa both. But this is an electric vehicle technically but when it comes to riding experience it feels the same. So my suggestion is to go for it!
The best pro is savings, savings and savings!
Buy one asap!!
A. It's an Indian brand.
B. Make clean air available for our kids and for us too!",TVS iQube,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
How good the TVS iQube EV scooter is a very much premature stage to claim how good it is in the field conditions. But some of the points to be looked can be discussed as follows. Battery - with it’s 2.2 kw battery it’s more than enough in city ride conditions say for everyday commute. With this power iqube offers a range of 75 km/h which is slightly better than Chinese rebadged scooters from other competitors. Motor power of 4.5 kw offers a better acceleration of 0–40kmph in 4.2 seconds which is slightly better too given the other competitors. A kerb weight of 118 kgs offer better dynamic riding conditions. With the low price tag next to Chetak as 1.15 lakhs is literally a competitive priced EV scooter in India than Ather and other vehicles. A charging time of 4–5 hours is enough for a day's ride with average city riding office to home commute. With geo-fencing and other loaded options vehicle looks cooler and slim compared to the others in market. Personally i would say the final performance and acceptability verdict is to be given by the sales numbers alone. That will really show how good the acceptance rate of the vehicle is. Thanks.,TVS iQube,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

"One of my close aides owns it I had ridden his this vehicle, a terrific scooter like TVs wego which I own since 2012, balance manageability, terrific look, outstanding performance on road, cons range should be more, less pricing as if it's at per with wego price more buyers will take it, all subsidy TVs is absorbing, not passing to customers as they have base price despite taking fame subsidy from the government, bad business practice, the government should look into this. This will help more buyers for TVS.",TVS iQube,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"I bought tvs iqube on sep 14 2021 and within one week it disappointed me according to the body condition, the rear housing panel cracked. I was not aware that its a manufacturing defect and I spent my money and replaced it, but after that within 4 to 5 days i went to the dealership and complained about it and i was told as if i have done that and after too much of shouting with the service people and mailing to customer care and also to tvs motor company. Riding in the same condition, cracks got extended till the front panel is also damaged.
I got a return mail saying that our representative will be contacting you and i got a phone call from the dealership and was asked to come on 18 oct 2021. I went on that day and left my scooter for fixing and until today its with them and there is no clarity of what is happening, if i call they are saying will call me and update and its almost 1 week now and I don't have my own scooter to move around. Still awaiting for the response.",TVS iQube,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,2
"The price is good with the features available on a scooter. The state govt of Chhattisgarh should also give a subsidy on this.

"We'll, this bike will meet the interests of many Indians, in many factors, excluding a few like riding range and speed. But still, if you're daily riding range is less than 130-120 kms and able to maintain an idle speed of 60 to 70 km/h, then this bike will serve you the best. In terms of braking, combined braking system is provided and it's performing just as much as required. Ergonomics are good, comfort factor is well prioritized by the makers. The bluetooth connectivity is an interesting element which grabs the attention of the youth. Although there are plenty of features on the app which are necessary in the present day, but the throttle sound feature was awesome. That's the feature which makes the bike special when compared to the other ev's in the nation. In terms of electrical vehicles it's worthy to get a new bike as early as possible. The main reason is, governments are encouraging, fuel prices are peaking (even if they get back to normal, prices will rise in the near future), and it's always good to get adapted with the changes.
At last this bike provides all the features similar to a 150cc naked bike, apart from the ride range and gearing feel.",Revolt RV 400,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

"First of all , it's a great bike for daily use , you will not have any problem if you are going to use it for traveling daily 30 to 40 kms , but when it comes to weight it is a little more but we have to compromise it to have a great motor power. It was not available for a month near my residence but I got it after 1 month so you can call the supplier and book it 15 days beforehand.

Absolutely terrible as no one in revolt is responding to the query and the wait till still continues after 7 months? sarcastic and going on booking further orders to accumulate crores and there is no word on the delivery.

I took a test ride in Pune city and found it a good ev option better than the scooter option.
Booked on Nov 21, buy paying 20k as booking amount, got slot of Feb-mar 22. To date didn't receive a bike.
They don't have any customer support department or no options to solve customer issues.
Their calls didn't get connected before 10min.
Even after connecting you will get an answer that your complaint has escalated, and our people will get back to you( which never happens and didn't happen in 7 months).

"Revolt motors is a fraud company. They provided a booking to me in december 2021 at navi mumbai hub and promised delivery by march-April 2022. All questions regarding booking to their customer support were redirected to say my delivery date is not yet near so the dealership will contact you near the delivery date. After the delivery date was passed, upon contact with revolt motors, customer service agents finally admitted they have no dealership operating in navi Mumbai, and my booking is indefinitely delayed. They keep lying and repeatedly asking me to wait a few more days. I contacted revolt motors to change my booking from non-existent navi mumbai hub to the actual mumbai hub in andheri which is 45 minutes from where I live.Revolt motors failed to transfer the booking to mumbai hub despite my offer to pay for the bike in full without financing. The mumbai hub has a telephone number that is always switched off.Mumbai hub offered to pursue my booking if I pay them in advance in full and then wait for them to deliver me my bike.However, revolt motors customer service representatives stated motorcycle will not be issued unless they transfer the hub for my booking and then failed to do the hub transfer. I urge everyone to recognize this company may be pulling a scam by taking people's booking amounts and delivering nothing.

"Well, 1st of all its totally visually appealing. Awesome ergonomics, built quality looks premium.Although it is an electric bike its safer for our environment also, so i congratulate revolt to bring the future in our reach. Now its time for the truth, the most important than any question , is it worth to get one ?? lets find out together.Pros :- 1) its an electric bike (green).2) anyone , even students can afford it with mrp(my revolt plan) scheme.3) looks great. Even built quality also never compromised by revolt.4) high-tech apps features (not all features are disclose as of now, so there should be more premium features letter on ) ex- geo fensing , exhaust sound change , keyless , and riding modes.5) swapping station and battery delivery concept.6) lifetime battery warranty.7) unlimited service by revolt under mrp(my revolt plan).8) though its an electric bike the lower end pick up is heavily high.9) usd(up-side down forks).10) led head drls & projector head lamp.11) led tell lamp.15) fast charging (75% charge in 2.5hour / full charge 4-4.5 hour).16) can be charge at any place with an 15mm port.17) can run up to 150km after one charge.18) cost efficient.Cons:-1) there is no abs.2) lack of speed. (max speed 80km/h)3) weight carrying capacity. (not more than 150kg)4) battery weight is too heavy almost 19-20kg. They said if your bike run out of battery then you can carry the batter charge it and put it back and you good to go. But i don't think it is to carry 20kg.5) it is an electric bike so its initial pick up is very high so you need to be very concerned while rev the acceleration.6) the engine power could be more powerful , overall you making a bike not scooter.(personal opinion).7) bike looks great but very compact which make this look like a toy.8) additional body graphics is missing which i believe can be added.9) the bike has no exhaust sounds, but there is a speaker which produce artificial exhaust sound and it totally understandable that the sound is artificial.Now the questions:-1) should i buy this bike ??Ans :- of course.. I will buy this bike when it will available in my area.2) why ?Ans :- because, not every superhero wear mask..",Revolt RV 400,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
"1. In terms of power and design of the bike, you can compare it with any 150 cc bike available in market like ""pulsar, fz etc."" which ranges from Rs. 70,000 to 90000. However, you would be paying around 1,50,000 for this bike.
Plus side - eco friendly
Negative side - twice expensive, Compromise on speed and range
2. My Revolt Plan is nothing but a veil of LOAN for this bike from financial institution, ""RattanIndia Finance"" for which you would be paying 18% rate of interest and the same has already been included in My Revolt Plan.
Plus side - Zero Down Payment
Negative side - Compulsion of taking loan and submission of alot of documents and paper work.
3. No doubt there are alot of new features being show cased like remote controlled, push start button, operating bike from mobile phone, changing sound, geo fencing. I believe other features like DRLs are quite common features which are available in every bike now a days.
At the time of taking the test drive of this bike, i was told that you can only start the bike either from a remote or mobile phone and not from a key. They could not answer when I asked them how to start the bike if remote stopped working and my mobile phone is out of battery.
Although, sound coming out from the speaker is an interesting feature, however, maximum sound in itself is not at all loud and thrilling.
My overall experience with representatives at Revolt Showroom was very bad as they were neither welcoming nor were aware about the complete specifications of the bike nor could answer to my queries.

"The biggest issue before going electric is range and performance. The bike is below mediocre in both. Stated range of 100 km is not enough. If we travel 30km to and fro add to it the loss of inefficiency we are staring at 70-80 kms range which would put battery to its limits since stated range is always far fetched. Now lets add realistic assumptions. 1-the sub tropical climate of india with scorching summers of 40+ radically affects battery life and range over years. We are starting at 70% efficiency within 2-3 years at best. Though the decline after initial fall would be slower. Typical reason why most manufacturers prefer liquid cooling for battery. If they don’t for cost savings, stay away for you will pay in future. 2-the battery life also depends on its peak charge and its lower extremity over repeated use. Maintaining a charge of 80% as max would be suitable most of the time and so for downsides of 20% that limits the battery charge usable to 60% for regular days. 60% of 100km - inflated statement (assume 20%) - 2-3 years degradation We are already staying at range of 40-60 kms depending on individuals driving habits and use case. I would happily pay a premium for electric is performance parameters are atleast at par with regular bikes from range to top-speed. I fully understand the economics under play and rate of returns and current bikes of range 100-150 are not worth it. Add to it their limited to speed and rigidity. Waiting for 4th gen products. Remember what happened with smart phones. We barely recall what first few generations looked like until they are good enough to attract our attention. Till that time let’s enjoy the last of this smoking hot barrels.",Revolt RV 400,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,2

"Buying experience: not great. While booking the bike, the price was 1.38lacs ( on-road price). They called me after 2 months, and when I asked about the manufacture date, they said it's the last year, I refused to take it. Again I got a call in may to make the payment, for which I paid rs. 1.49 lacs. They said: 1 bike chips are in high demand and 2. Bike prices increased. Now the latest price is rs. 1.51 lacs. They even don't offer a glass of water to their customers forget offering tea/coffee. Once you made the payment, they are taking you for granted.
2. Riding experience: this bike is not fit if your height is less than 167cm. The seat is too hard, and the max. Weight it carries 130 kgs. The riding quality is good.
3. Details about looks, performance etc: looks wise it is good, after you purchase the bike, you need to buy an additional stabilizer ( compulsory) which you need to invest around 3k more.
4. Pors and cons: pros it's ev and has smooth riding quality.
Cons: they provide an additional bill, which doesn't have any gst number, it is just about balancing the extra payment you made. You need to pay for every additional screw. Nothing free here.",Revolt RV 400,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,3
"So here's something to ponder and consider before you make a purchase of the revolt rv 400.
I had the terrible misfortune of having booked and fully paid for the electric bike.
1. For one, the delivery of the bike is delayed and after claiming 100% amounts in advance
2. But, what I found ridiculous is the following facts:
Did you know they try and sell you an insurance cover, which is much higher priced?
Well, they do and so I got my own insurance and they had to minus the amounts, which they would have otherwise charged
Did you know they literally force down your throats a sub-standard helmet, which is much higher priced, than any helmet currently available on the market?
Now here is what baffled me no end!
The director at koramangala, bangalore, tells me that, he will not deliver my bike unless I, either take the revolt sub-standard helmet at a higher price or produce a recent invoice showing the purchase of a helmet.
Anyways, since I did not like or want the revolt helmet, I proceeded to make a purchase of a helmet I liked.
Then I am told that I need to give them a 'printed' tax invoice.
Now the attachment is the tax invoice that the seller was able to generate; but according to him, this won't do.
So when did a start-up brand in India dictate which helmet I need to use?
What happens if someone already has a better helmet. They cannot get the bike?
When was it that, a start-up brand began forcing us customers to buy anything?
This seems unlawful and must be addressed immediately.
Last but not the least, I do believe a brand will achieve far more with someone better equipped and knowledgeable.",Revolt RV 400,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

"Bajaj Chetak has increased the price of their electric scooter for second time without any noticeable up gradation. The first hike was Rs.5000/- and thereafter a whopping hike of Rs.27000/- in March 2021.”Bajaj” is exploiting the trust of Indian customers who are having great faith in this brand. On the contrary, the manufacturer has little sentiments for their trusted customer and encashing every opportunity to swallow the subsidy amount and hard earned money of the buyers. As a thumb rule the production cost goes down with increase in production volume. Then why so frequent and intense price hikes? this is not only the story of Bajaj Chetak, every second electric scooter that gain slightest popularity has adopted the similar strategy, like Ather-450x who did raise a few months back. They have no ethics, no sentiments for environment, country or people. I appeal to general public to boycott their products, there are many other great options available in Indian market, and we just need to give a fair trial to many other new manufacturers. Our entrepreneurs must imbibe the thinking of Elon Musk, co-founder of Tesla Electric Company, whose sole motive is to save environment and promote electric cars.

No service at all, you have to wait 15-20 mins on call to reach them, and end of the call you have to disconnect it without getting any solution to the problem.

Everything is fantastic. You must try the cruise. Also the modes which change the sounds with it are amazing. The cool pick up and the key less features adds up to my fascinating list. So... All I want to say is.. Do not think to buy this . Just go for it.,OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"I booked ola just to get a test ride by paying an advance of 500. I should say I was bowled over when I did the test ride. I was not serious to buy ola but then when they gave the gerua colour offer on holi, i bought it. From the date of full payment, I got the vehicle in about a month's time. Everything was done through the app. Updates were coming as notifications. However, there was no way to know the real-time information about the delivery status. It was carefully packed while delivering but the number plate was already bent.
It is the silence during the ride that I like the most. No sound from the motor, just the new tyre sounds. Pickup is amazing. Whenever we decide we can easily accelerate and pass other vehicles.
The look is the same as etergo the netherland scooter. The only con with the looks is that it looks like a scooty and not a scooter. The under-seat capacity is good enough to hold my laptop if I leave the charger and other items behind. The range is about 90 km. There was a sudden drop to 0 in just 10 seconds and the vehicle switched off when the range was still showing 45 km. They claim a true range of 135 km for s1 pro but that is not true. I had to get that towed to my home taking their roadside assistance but it took me 6 hours to get the scooter home. I am doing a hard reset of the s/w as instructed by them every other day so that the display will show the right range. There will be a loss of about 5% battery every night when you are not charging. There is a slight lag in the pickup initially but then it moves fast. The reverse mode gives a push and doesn't respond for a few seconds. Again another push and then gets cut off. It is safer this way compared to the complaints I hear from other customers of over-speeding in the reverse mode and going forward when reversing.
I have not gone for a service or maintenance. It is still new - I have driven about 400 km so far. Their customer care was friendly and helpful. They followed up a couple of times after the issue was resolved. I am still awaiting the upgrade of the software version which will have all the other features that were promised for s1 pro - cruise control, hill control, Bluetooth, navigation, etc. Hyper charging stations are yet to be installed in bangalore. The front shocks are making me worry because there is a noise and there are complaints of this breaking when negotiating speed breakers.
Overall, this is a good and ambitious scooter project which failed miserably. Ola has to re-brand its scooter and earn customer loyalty to remain in the market. Significant pros are the looks, under-seat capacity, and display system. Cons are unfirm rear grips, useless front leg room (you can't keep your grocery box or bag there due to the central hump), flimsy side stand (center stand is not a possibility by design), and not useful for saree-clad women on the rear - no footrest for them, control buttons are difficult to reach.",OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,3

"Got the scooter delivered on Jan 3rd, 2022.
Payment process : was one of the first early adopters - reserved her for 500 on july 23. 2 months later, paid an advance of 20k, and got an invite to take the test ride 15 days later. Paid the final amount in October, and received the delivery window of December 15-31. The ola representative called in December end for final confirmation and soon received the intimation of insurance and registration payment from icici lombard and rto respectively. Home delivered in a mini truck.
Idv on insurance : 155400
Actual cost : 197400 (ex showroom 163549, smart card - 200, postal fee - 50, registration - free, zero dep insurance - 7632, portable charger - 9000, performance upgrade - 17000)
Fame ii subsidy : 59550 (15000 per kwh - 15000*3.97)
Maharashtra state subsidy : 29850 (5000 per kwh - 5000*3.97 = 19850 + 10000 additional)
Total subsidy discount : 89400
Effective on road price : 108000
Real world range : 135 kms in normal, 120 km in sports, 95 km in hyper
Arai claimed range : 181 kms
Design language : a big fan, front leds are as powerful as a dominar's and cute like wall e's face! it's parent company etergo won the german design award in 2020, so there's that too! floorboard isn't flat, but compensates by providing a 36lt boot space, that can fit 2 half face helmets, and 1 full face ls2 ece helmet sideways. Turn indicators chime through the in built speakers. Display is 7"". Stock horn is typical road runner type (90s kids relate?)
Riding : very agile, planted in corners, thick 120 section mrfs provide good grip. Seat height is 790mm and well padded and you sit taller than the traffic (i'm 6 feet). Motor whines while accelerating (it's addictive). The bugs of the beta software have been fixed, and now the scooter runs a stable os.
Performance : 0-40 : 3 seconds, 0-60 : 5 seconds, top speed : 115 kmph, torque : 58nm (accelerates in hyper mode arguably as fast as a dominar 400/ duke 250)
Charging : likes to take it in the ass through a 750w portable charger. Charging time : 6.5 hours. 6amp connection taken from home.
Running costs : 4.54km/rupee or rs. 0.22/km. In comparison, a bike returning 35 km/l at 105/litre equals rs.3/km
Battery warranty : 3 years
Battery life : 7 years (claimed)
Battery replacement cost : Rs. 60000 (info provided by technician, subject to drop in price as adoption increases)
Niggles : delivery date was pushed by 4 days, but guess have to give ola credit for innovation, so no complaints.
Future updates :
March 2022 - gps, navigation and bluetooth
June 2022 - cruise control, hill hold etc",OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"To own electric vehicles is best bet today. India is the biggest two wheeler market in the world. Ev adoption is increasing rapidly world wide. India is also prepping to become ev super power with great products by ola electric, amo electric bikes, hero electric, Ather energy, ampere electric and more.",OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
"Let's start it from its exterior. The ola s1 pro has got fabric body and the battery part is metallic finish to protect the battery. The ola s1 pro has got all led lights including indicators, headlamp, taillamp and the s1 pro has got 2 led headlamps and you can choose to light up 1 or both. Coming to the touch screen of s1 pro, the touch screen has got all information regarding the s1 pro the speed, battery, km driven, km left to drain battery and also it got a bluetooth connectivity for maps. BTW it has a offline map also for attending calls, cutting the calls. The s1 pro have 2 speakers, could you believe it. You can listen songs by bluetooth connectivity on them and the s1 pro has got a usb socket also and the utlity space on both the knee sides. Now moving on to the top speed of s1 pro. OMG, the first scooter I have ever seen which reaches 110-115 km/h easily. It has got 3 modes normal, sport, hyper. Whenever you switch modes from normal the screen shows you the decreasing battery which is normal. The full capacity of full charge running of s1 pro is approx 180 kms which is awesome. Now let's move to the boot space, It has got very huge boot space. You can easily fit 2 helmets on it. Now moving to the looks, touchwood the ola s1 pro is very good looking and premium scooter. You get alloys and both disc brakes.. In my opinion it is the best smart electric scooter available in India with decent price.. The price of s1 pro is approx 1,20000 INR.
Now move to the pros and cons
Pros-
1-looks
2-performance
3-heallty for nature
4-resonable for running cost
5-boot space
6- the smart touch screen
7-and more and more mileage
Now let's move to the cons
Cons-
1-costly price
2-mono shock suspension.",OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
"Yeah, I experienced the best of riding the bike with the amazing features of a digital system without a physical key which is encrypted as a passcode which enables a customer to easier without losing the physical access,
Secondly, the side lock system is good and needs some more tricky.
The mileage of this bike is obvious and the riding experience is great smoother.
The digital system is much amazing as expected totally everything is good the rating of this bike is 4.8 starings.",OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"The worst customer care and the bike is not giving 180 as mentioned it will give around 100 to 120 only.
A charge is quickly dropping. It's not recommended for long rides (you can take 10 to 15 kms if emergency)
You may think of saving the cost of petrol, but it will waste all your money on charging itself..",OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Bought an ola during the holi window.
Procedural time is understandable. Delivery was pathetic there was a dispute between the transporter and truck owner the vehicle was helped up on the truck for 3 days. The rep was rude but answered the mobile.
Riding the scooter has power alright. Was disappointed there is no navigation preinstalled. The rep says there will be a software update. There is a scraping sound when above 35km/hr also there is a vibration that you can feel on the foot if you wear chappals. Called the company rep and he said to ride for 500km if still there to call customer care. Overhaul I'm concerned about the vibration it's 200km and still, both are there.
Looks are great and good performance too.
It's new so no idea about the servicing or maintenance.
Looks great, spacious compartment, very silent, keyless, enough range for my daily requirements",OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
"I haven't bought this yet but was thinking. The riding review with one of my friends was little jerky while riding.
The looks of this bike are very much different from other EVs its eye-catching, cool looks with multiple color options to choose from.
Can't talk about the performance.
Now coming to the servicing part I think the OLA is on the trails and errors stage and the base is not set yet to resolve the issues of its riders and customers but I believe that they will come up with the resolutions very soon for the issues which their customers are facing.
Pros-
Firstly it is an EV.
Amazing looks.
Cons-
Launched in Dec-2021 in cold weather, yet to experience till this summer ends that how many more complaints to be seen and also should get ready for Mumbai rainy season to come.
-It Will be more helpful for its riders if they keep the availability of their spare parts and prompt service.
Until then I will not opt for EV but I wish all the best to OLA to do good to save the Environment.",OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,3
"Easy to purchase, easy to ride with good pickup, looks awesome with simplicity, performance as per company commitments, servicing and maintenance is low in cost and on time. Pros - save fuel and also save nature without making pollution of air and sound and cons- is charging availability on a long journey.",OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"1. Buying experience: they really made us wait for a very long period, took 2 months more than the promised delivery date.
2. Riding: it is just amazing and the top speed on paper is 115 km/h but in real in turbo mode, it gives a top speed of 70km/h and the charging time is not so much because when we see the range after 100% charging the vehicle it gives a range of 135 kms. The charging time is 7 to 7.30 hours.
3. Looks and performance: amazing looks and superb performance.
4. Pro: ride quality and eco friendly, pick up too good, comfortable for 2 people, has a large boot space, built quality is very good.
5. Con:
A) the functional buttons are very difficult to operate.(horn, turn indicator etc)
B) manual key lock is necessary
C) back number plate often hits the leg
D) side stand quality could have been better.
E) horn sound is very inadequate.
F) in real-life conditions it gives only 100 to 130 kms for one full charge(s1 pro)
F) fast-charging stations and not available
G) you cannot hold the brakes and accelerate the bike.
H) misses out on flat floorboard
I) unimpressive plastic quality
J) there is a scraping sound when above 35km/hr also there is a vibration that you can feel on the foot if you wear chappals.",OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
"Buying experience is still frustrating. Riding the S1 Pro is great. Software is full of bugs. It abruptly goes into reverse mode without any input, even when the cluster shows that it is in forward mode. Power delivery is not consistent. Battery reaches high temperature pretty easily. Even the percentage shown in the cluster is not correct.",OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
Performance is good but the thing is range will drop drastically to 0 sometimes and the service team is very worst they will keep scooter 20-30 days with them and won't solve the problems completely. For a new scooter they took it around 10-12 times to the service station and the thing everything is online we cannot go and ask for our rights there.,OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"I booked s1 pro on dussera 2021 with an expectation to be delivered by the year-end, booking amount was 500 rs so wasn't much wishful, as I booked a tesla model 3 on 2016 which is never delivered in India (1000 usd booking). Anyways was surprised to receive a mail near holi to make final payments and my scooter will be delivered by may end. I was excited and made full payment and they did abide by the promise.
The delivery experience was smooth and coordinated and I faced no hassles in getting delivered at home in nagpur apart from a last-minute glitch of having the wrong scooter delivered but it was an honest mix-up as both same colors and assigned for a similar area. The initial impression of the scooter was very negative, having owned a honda dio for over a decade I was at least expecting my helmet to fit in the trunk which, despite being spacious wasn't the right size for storing my regular-sized helmet. And where is the center stand? it's an absolute must but if they did for the sensor and software issue. At least they had provision for the same and I got an aftermarket stand installed separately.
The driving experience is definitely an upgrade from traditional ice - the ride height, suspension system, dual disc brakes, wide and comfortable seats, and peppy motor make it check all boxes in the ride quality section. Its looks are unique and definitely head turner! software is another matter however ev makes it 40% software and 60% hardware. And the software is buggy - the charge level problems, occasional lags in the interface, and delay in promised updates do not look good on ola's books.
I haven't faced any maintenance needs and do not expect any necessity to service since there aren't any mechanical parts. The range is great and I do manage to get about 135-140 on a single charge as promised true range. Perhaps if I use regen braking more aggressively I may be able to manage more juice out of it, but I don't feel the need since I mostly cruise and only use it for leisure travels.
My friend's test drove this scooter as well, and they were all thrilled and enjoyed the ride! almost everyone mentioned the negative news coverage this is getting which I can understand by the framing effect people have.",OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"I buy online but no finance options are available for me even though my cibil was 790, so I made a down payment 1.56 lac. The riding experience is awesome. I purchased this ev just for looks and features. I only need servicing one time and my ev picked up and drop to my residence but the problem is, no service center is available in kanpur, the nearest service center in lucknow. Good pickup, looks but the features promised by the company is still under development so I am feeling ditched by the company.",OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
"Pathetic after-sale service, no coordination among ola representatives and service department and half-baked product and half-baked software plus false commitment and fake promise and weak body quality.
The cost is very high.
People should think and wait before investing a big amount of money and ola is capable but the service which is the most important part is pathetic among all ev.",OLA S1 Pro,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,2
"After the release of ola scooter and especially simple one, I feel cheated. Even a small company like simple one is exceeding by far on every aspect (203 km range, 72 nm torque etc.). Ather has been extorting money in the name of fancy vehicle. Taking advantage of consumers because you have a monopoly is not a way to earn trust of your customers.
Highly doubt Ather will ever deliver anything at the right price.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
I got the bike delivery within 10 days of the order. A very good experience riding the bike. Looks are very attractive performance is best in the segment and live feature is amazing with the online app of ather. The only problem is the range is only 70km after full charge but if you got a portable charger you can charge it anywhere.,Ather 450X,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
Loved this amazing swadeshi-made vehicle!!! very good performance without any problem. Storage space is quite spacious. The back footrest is very comfortable. Reverse gear is an added advantage. Charging is very easy. Looks good. Customer service is fine. Overall good performance. Definitely would like to recommend this vehicle. The only suggestion company can think of little more mileage (km/charge),Ather 450X,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
Superb riding experience and its too smooth. Every one should ride the Ather scooter also good mileage and speed on traffic area.,Ather 450X,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Riding experience is good but the cost wise its very costly also the price mentioned in ""bikewale"" is also wrong, and its range is the second brand killer for Ather 450x with only 85 kms in a single charge. Ather 450x is the costliest electric scooter in India, its on road is 1.65 lakh, so price wise it is my personal review not to go with this scooter, other emerging brands are arriving in 2022, so its never late to wait for a perfect model to get launched.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"To conserve our environment, use of electric vehicles is an proactive action. Electric vehicles help reduce vehicular pollution, noise pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and more. In upcoming years, India is becoming an EV superpower since many e-mobility companies such as Ather energy, ola electric, AMO electric bikes, Simple energy, Ampere vehicles, Okinawa are all ready to penetrate Indian EV space with great products.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
"Best electric vehicle this is. Compared to ola and other electric vehicles this is the best I have felt. Though ola gives more range than Ather. For example Ather is like Samsung and iPhone. Others are like oppo, vivo and mi. |From my experience I drive daily for 40-50 kms per day. I don't need higher km range as I do not go touring in this. So I feel Ather will be better to buy. Its quietly simple and awesome. It's features are not too low nor too high and it is simple as I am.. Simple things always looks good and attractive.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Took a small test drive. Experience was good. The vehicle body frame and design are good. Belt drive may be a under design. The mileage of 85 kms per charge is very low compared to what claimed by ola and simple one. Very very highly priced. (on road rs1.51/- at Chennai) service cost of 2500/- at every 5000kms is also very high, subscription of app 2400/- per annum is also high. No free service. With very few electric scooters in market, they might survive now. In a year or two, they might not be in the market or might loose business if they don’t reduce the price and with other competitors coming in soon. For this price, it is not worth. If you have money and conscious about environment, you can buy.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,2
"Just walked into the showroom Ather space , madhapur, Hyderabad...Excellent reception and test ride went so smooth and booked my 450x. It's a premium e-scooter just like an apple's iPhone. This scooter is designed perfection to the core. Of course very few minor flaws are there just like few dashboard software glitches. But overall riding experience and comfort and quality is just unmatchable. Because before buying this tried several brand's e scooters but none of them were able to match the quality of Ather 450x. Of course it is expensive but every penny which we spent on this is 100% wrathful. Its premium so obviously the price also little premium only. You don't believe when ever i stop my scooter at signals most of the people will ask about the scooter because of its attractive looks and dashboard. Once if you test ride the vehicle i am sure you will love it. Pickup is amazing. For city commute it is the best. And Ather is offering free grid charging also which is an added advantage. Overall the best Ather 450x. So far I have finished 1000kms in 45days. Combi disc brakes are really amazing works perfect. I wont say about future but in the current market 450x is best.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"I am a two wheeler lover.
The ather 450is fulfills my needs by being
1 maintenance free.
2. Excellent pickup.
3. Experience a good regeneration during coasting.
4. Good braking distance to achieve short control.
5 stability on road.
6 comfortable seating arrangement.
7 good dealer support
8 timeline delivery.
9. Wonderful on line support form technical team.
10. Last ather is price to invest.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"A tad bit overpriced but its the best EV currently in the market don't fall for the trap of ola and simple one, just test drive either way before buying.
Ather is a proven commodity for past two years whereas ola and simple don't have it yet.
Ather servicing and customer service is very good even in the extreme circumstances they were of help to me.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"I love this scooter, is it most powerful smart scooter than any other scooter.
Suspension is very smooth.
Superior Ride.
Unbelievable torque
I reached a top speed of 93 km/h
The sound is like a boing 737 JET.
I like this smart display with 4G connectivity...
GPS system
Accuracy of range in kilometers
On display as well as mobile phone.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Those who are giving Ather 450X bad rating are only rating in terms of pricing though it is somewhat costly but Ather is way to good then any other vehicle out there in market. It's speed and pick-up is awesome and as per my daily use it gives minimum 85 km of mileage per charge. So, people who are reviewing it bad must see it from every angle.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Buying Experience:
Buying experience is pathetic, i have pre-booked vehicle by seeing an ad with false information. Waited 11 months to receive vehicle.
No proper information given at purchase time also. No proper invoice it self.
Govt discount will go to company account.
Just a very normal electric scooter given for an amount of 1.89 lacs money
All the other features need subscription and subscription amount changed multiple times before even start
Riding Experience:
One good thing is pickup, but shock absobers are pathetic. Need flat road to have peaceful riding.
Public Charging points not available properly, and those available does not work, and it need solid 6 hours to get charged
Company claims 15km for 10 mins charging but it never works with fast charging also (tested from ather Experience center it self)
Ather mobile app is just a waste it wont show basic information also with out subscription.
Maps and dashboard get stuck in the middle and make u get confused with no information on how many km left on drive
Keeping idle will reduce charging, 15% went to zero in 2 days.
No portable charger, we need to pay 10K more to get portable charger even after buying scooter with premium amount of 1.89 lacs
Over all no satisfaction from 1.89 lacs scooter, it will be just a show piece after few months.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

"its a best bike for city but price is too much. The bike's real cost is around 90k to 100k but its overpriced and the company has many plans. Its cost shows like 2.4k for a year and including service plan but they have raised the price too much, Overall best bike but new Ola bike is arriving soon. Ola may be a best option than Ather 450x.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Ride experience is too good. It has wonderful braking confidence in moped category of this segment and the best suspension as well.
Color options & design of this model is very much attractive.
It would be good if Ather can focus to maximize the charge points through out Hyderabad as their volumes of business grow much faster.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Don't know why people are rating this bike low. I am a using this from April 2021, my daily run is 60-62 km, everyday I take my Ather to home and office, there is no single point where I can say I paid too much for this. Honestly I am satisfied and I am feeling more younger when I sit on it and ride it. This Ather team has made a marvel.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
"Hassle free buying experience with skilled technicians...Replaced my rx 135 with ather450x, liked performance same as rx with 450x. Service persons are too fantastic and best in this price range....Not tired of continues riding at 40 km/h and 85 km/h upto 50km ride.... Comfort and speed is the best part of Ather 450x.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Pricing is too much as you need to pay more. No proper assistance.
Don't buy Ather go for TVS or Bajaj.
Insurance costs you 5000 rupees.
Check other electric vehicles as their pricing is less than Ather.
TVS iQube is good at its price or check Bajaj Chetak.
Wait for more EV's to come in years. The future is electric only.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Pros:-
Comfortable in riding. No back pain and good experience while taking delivery. May be more than a 150 cc bike. Brakes are good does the work
Seats is like a jelly seat it is also good.

Subscriptions for facilities I hated it. Range is not getting as described.
Price is very high not easy for a middle class.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Previous model was around 1.2 lakh now 1.8 lakh, even we can ride petrol bike buy pay 200 per liter more .Also don't get trap for those they say about cost saving for that millage and speed we can buy good bike or scooter for less than a lakh still get a better mileage and cost effective. And monthly subscription for other features.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Buying Experience: not a happy experience for anyone due to a long waiting period and because of the pricing tag. 1.89 lakh's in Bangalore is the actual price. Only one branch in Bangalore and people need to go there for any small issues.
Riding Experience: pickup is the only good thing. Height is a little more and will.be tough for those with less than 5.5 feet height. Shock absorbers are worst and riding experience not good on uneven roads
Connected features need a subscription. Otherwise even an app or charging station charging does not work
Just around 70 to 75 km actual distance with one charge which needs 5 hours to charge again.
Looks: ok ok, different look but not so comfortable. Very few options in colors also.
Servicing: only one service center in all over Bangalore, company say they will pick and drop but that need a subscription.
Pros:
Pickup
Make in India
Cons:
Price, 1.89 lakh's actual on-road price (government gives 29k discount)
Government discount will go to company pocket.
5 hours charging needed for 75 km travel.
Only one branch in Bangalore for all service and issues.
After-sales response is not very good.
The charger is external and needs to be fixed to the wall.
Long travel not feasible as the bike does not have an internal charger.
An external charger is heavy and costs 15k extra.
Proper planning of ride needed, one wrong route will screw-up our travel.
Very few charging points and many do not work.
The battery will discharge while biking not in use.
Worst shock absorbers.
Extra height.
Subscription for servicing.
Subscription use maps and connected features.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

"The heaviest part of the bike i.E. The battery is above the wheel hub (bearing) line thus making the centre of gravity higher. I have noticed that you cant tilt much when cornering or the vehicle will definitely lose balance. Will be tough to ride this on wet streets in monsoons. This is a major safety issue. Also, the battery doesn't look like it will last long.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,2
"It's a beast for the price you pay. You can compare its performance to a Duke 250 on full throttle but ignoring the top speed. It goes up-to 80kmph in the city which is enough and what I liked is the build quality. Things you must keep in mind b4 buying the bike:
1. You need to charge it regularly and manage it well. If you can't manage the vehicle by charging it regularly or forget often to charge, don't buy this vehicle.
2. You need to understand how the ecosystem works. The hefty price is not only for the vehicle. You get other services as well. Although for 1.6L I definitely feel it's worth it. You don't have to pay for petrol. That's a huge W.
3. Make sure you know the nearest charging station so that it's convenient for you to charge your vehicle fast.
Don't worry they provide you with a charger at home as well.
4. You need to be gentle with the brakes. The bite is too good and you need to get used it.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"My daughters wanted me to buy only electric scooter - for the environment they said. So i booked in august and collected by bike yesterday! riding the bike is an awesome experience... Smooth and effortless ride.. Only issue is the slightly shady billing and invoicing process - even though i paid 1,68,989/- invoice says 1,39,989! ather is issuing two separate invoices - one for less amount (1,39,000) where they claim fame ii incentive and one more additional invoice of balance amount where they are simply charging claiming some upgrade...Thus effectively the individual don't get the fame incentive! so according to this ather 450x will be around 1,90,000!",Ather 450X,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Riding is excellent, quality up to mark, key is still the best way to operate a two wheeler, acceleration is epic.
Ather needs to improve the rear view mirror and increase no of charging stations. Introduce cruise control through software update. Still a good option in 2022 i wish the price can be reduced by better subsidy rules.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

ATHER Price includes the charger price but for TVs iqube we have to spend another 8500 rs..no touch screen and I personally visited the showroom the way they take of the customers too worst and Ather they will give u the best customer experience.

"This is my honest review after riding for 7500 km and 9 months.
I bought this bike in Aug 2021. The buying experience was not that great, but all that faded out in the excellent performance and quality of this bike. The riding experience was amazing. What I found was Ather has tested this bike in most Indian conditions and it is well suited for Indian roads. Looks are undoubtedly sporty, performance is superb has mentioned in numbers in the website.
I had done one service after 5000 km, it cost me some 1200 rs. No maintenance charges except service.
Pros.
1. Excellent Performance
2. Looks
3. No maintenance except servicing
4. Service cost is low
5. Riding experience
6. Useful OTA updates
Cons.
1. Price is comparatively high
2. Buying experience is not impressive
3. Range is 90 km. Which would have been 150km for the daily commute.",Ather 450X,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Worst bike and the service, it was the biggest mistake of buying this bike, since a year now the battery had a problem and no replacement, the battery is costing half of the new bike so it's totally waste. There is no service station in goa, they have to come from kolhapur and we have to pay separately for all the traveling expenses.",Hero Electric Optima,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
I purchased this Hero branded before 6 years. There is problem with battery from the beginning. But dealer not serviced and in 7 months totally bike was stopped. Also dealer told purchase new battery. He is not replace or service battery and after some days dealership also closed. So be careful. It's my experience.,Hero Electric Optima,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Horrible bike. After driving it for a year, I know in and out of this bike and its support. And my opinion is don't ever buy this junk bike. Reasons. 1. Company claims wrong figures about its mileage of 55 km/battery. My bike never gave me more then 45 km/battery. Company is fooling its customer through false claims. 2. Poor material of critical components like motor and battery. I already touched upon initial battery response. After a year, bike is giving less then 30 km on a full charge. The motor of bike has got damaged within a year. Both are covered under 3-year warranty, but support too is horrible. 3. Customer support is horrible. Even after 15 days of issue identification, company hasn't still replaced motor and battery that ere covered under a 3 year warranty. I reached out to their engineer many times a day, but no response from him. He neither picks up the calls, nor responds on what's-app. All the good will of hero motor corp is getting damaged because of this company (hero electric) and its employees.

3. Charging time min take 5.5 hrs. Instead of claim 4 hrs. I use stabilizer for charging.
4. Four times charging get stuck. I have to cut of mcb and turn on.
5. The claims vehicle run 10km with 47v . Absolute not. When it reaches 47v within a km or 2 km vehicle stops. . Battery indicator show different level. Please note every one . It doesn't run more than 50km.Better charge every 40km.",Hero Electric Optima,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,3

"Horrible bike. After driving it for a year, i know in and out of this bike and its support. And my opinion is don't ever buy this junk bike. Reasons 1. Company claims wrong figures about its mileage of 55 km/battery. My bike never gave me more then 45 km/battery. Company is fooling its customer through false claims. 2. Poor material of critical components like motor and battery. I already touched upon initial battery response. After a year, bike is giving less then 30 km on a full charge. The motor of bike has got damaged within a year. Both are covered under 3-year warranty, but support too is horrible. 3. Customer support is horrible. Even after 15 days of issue identification, company hasn't still replaced motor and battery that ere covered under a 3 year warranty. I reached out to their engineer many times a day, but no response from him. He neither picks up the calls, nor responds on whats-app. All the goodwill of hero motor corp is getting damaged because of this company (hero electric) and its employees.

Bought it amidst lockdown. Congratulations to hero electric for venturing into the field of riding with zero emission. Really appreciate such moves. Riding experience is good. Better suited for single riding rather than double carrying.. The battery of vrla model doesn't charge fully below 12 hours. Moreover the capacity of the motor to perform at battery levels below 30% is really poor. So after a maximum of 40kms one needs to recharge it for full performance. Probably the lithium version works better.,Hero Electric Optima,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,4

Worst company I have ever come across.",Hero Electric Optima,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"1)buying experience is very bad not fulfilled any comments,
2) not comfortable. 3) average. 4) very low quality material used required heavy maintenance.
5) breaking system is very poor. Drum break is always broken. Rainy & moist seasons breaks is not operate gives the noise and jam the whole scooter running it very horrible & difficult to move the vehicle even single inch also. Head light is low beam.",Hero Electric Optima,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Built quality is bad. Body parts are made up from poor quality plastic, mudguard, motor cover panels etc but battery performance is nice. Speed is sufficient for city ride but on climb, it feels lack of power. Company should improve their mechanics, costumer care, spear parts availability network etc.",Hero Electric Optima,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,3
"The waiting time after making the 3000/- advance is about 2 months. The vehicle built quality is not that good and breaks are not good. The distance covered per full charge is 100 km (expected). But the operational cost is very low compared to the petrol scooters. Service side till now I have not experienced. Seat is not that comfortable. If you have some alternative, then you may not think for it. Look wise ok. Speed is max 48 km/h which i got with 2 persons riding on it. The body parts are of fiber. Subsidy amount of 43000/- will come after 3 months of registration.",Hero Electric Optima,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,2
"The buying experience was just amazing. I was hoping to buy a scooter that helps my spouse to learn riding a scooter. It is really helping my spouse. I am using it on a daily basis to commute around 30 km. This has perfectly saved my pocket from fueling my car on daily commute. The only thing i am very much concerned is the speed. I bought a low speed model thinking that it is sufficient. Trust me it is not working out on roads like the omr it express way. If i have to make a turn on a 3 lane road, i really need to be cautious as the speed is not in sync with others on the road. I would suggest not to go with a low speed model. Rather get high speed models, that may come in good for such roads.",Hero Electric Optima,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,3

Which is too much high for Indian two wheeler market.And there is no charging station available so if we ride from mumbai to vapi-gujarat then we will have to drive for 100 km then for 70 km we bike need to be send by transporters vehicles.Option to change battery need to be available so we can carry two charged batteries while travelling for long distance.And price must be below 1 lakh, if govt provide subsidy then only people will be interested in buying environment friendly vehicles.",Tork Kratos,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,3

"This is one of the kickstart in the market of two-wheelers which will end a region of rising oil prices. The design of the bike is fairly based on fz-s, as it was tork motorcycle's 4th prototype. Since it is an electric bike, the fuel tank is converted into 11l boot space, large enough to fit a full sized helmet. The only issue it might face is the charging points.",Tork Kratos,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

"The price is decent for this bike, even if some users find the price a little high. The only difficulty we south Indians may face is that the showroom is up north. If we ever come across any issues , if would be hard for us to contact service centres. In all other aspects, i think this bike is gonna change everything. A huge relief would be that we don't have to pay for petrol anymore. The bike has decent power too which other electric scooters lack and of course it looks good.",Tork Kratos,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

"While in thailand we have rented 5 honda click scooters and 7 in total. The bike i rented from aya was poorly maintained, had half a tank of fuel when I rented, and i didn't feel comfortable riding it because of all the issue it had from prior accidents from previous customers. When asked to switch bikes there were none left so we ended up having to use it. Every other bike we have rented has been amazing.
As for the business side of things, the renting of the bike was ok but trying to return the bike was a hassle. The process was confusing and when we didn't have the receipt which was missed place whilst traveling, staff became very rude and unhelpful. The woman we were working with had the worst attitude when trying to exchange our bike for the passports and was generally very unpleasant to work with even for simple paperwork.",Tork Kratos,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

Perfect electric motorcycle",Tork Kratos,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

"Bike will set a benchmark in Indian daily commuting.
Bike has all the required attributes. It is only lagging in terms of safety. The company should allow dual channel ABS at least optional for the bike. With ABS it will be a complete package.

"On a whole tork t6x will costs you around 1.36lakh including taxes and all. Which looks slightly higher price for a normal guy like me to think of buying it. But, when i see the specifications (electric, design,mobile & bike connectivity, cloud connectivity with the manufacturers,top speed,charging time,water resistant battery) , i feel it is worthy to give a chance of buying.When it comes to the range(100km) , we might not getting the 100km range while driving on different roads using different speeds as 100km range suggests 0-100 percent battery. So we can get around 70km range while riding which is slightly lesser i feel, which is why i gave 4 stars,if it is around 150km then it would be the best choice.Coming to the tubeless tyres,abs breaking technology sounds good.I don't know whether the battery is detachable or not.Because detachable battery nodes are easier to carry for charging.",Tork Kratos,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
Must buy bike as it have capacity to run around 100 km and with lot of weight . So for daily need it's a comfortable bike to use in city and around city . Nothing else but enjoy. For gentle use and for mileage purpose it is a good choice as it can give only 10 paisa per km . It can neutralise burden of heavy petrol rate hike problem. Just go for it.,Tork Kratos,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

"I booked my ola s! and paid advance of 20k, waiting for test ride in a nearby city or at pollachi. I am impressed with specifications compare to other electric scooters. If i am correct initially ola claimed that batteries are removable, now understand it cannot be. Initially had some issues with the website but their customer support used to give call immediately and clarify doubts. Riding experience can be shared on having a test ride. Looks and performance looks to be good . Service and maintenance yet to be experienced. Pros - good rage for daily commuters, we support for a green world, good response from customer support. Cons: ola has not updated the test centers, delivery slot given to me is 1st to 31st dec,21. Have doubt by looking at the way it moves. No manual key is provided, all controls with smart phone. If I miss my smart phone what s the alternate. If other than me if my family members want to ride they should have app in their phone . Elderly person who has no knowledge on smart phone cannot use the vehicle. Some best solution to be suggested by ola",OLA S1,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"They cheated customers by creating hype. It stops surely but no one attends for service. Please don’t buy.
Customer service, they never lift. Don’t expect a service person will visit.
They don’t respond to emails too.
After 10 days, I tried roadside assistance, and it worked.
My scooter is ola s1 pro. Still, they have sent back scooters but they ask only to use 50% of the battery. How a joke it is.
I have had Nexon ev since more than a year. Never got into any trouble.
But my decision is wrong with ola scooter.
In my opinion, it’s not a reliable company, it’s to cheat on either customers or investors.",OLA S1,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Buying experience: the wait time was over and above the schedule and finally they made me visit their delivery point rather than delivering at the doorstep
Quality: post 300 km my vehicle stopped abruptly in the middle of the road while it was showing 35 km to cover and battery % came down to 0.
Service/maintenance: I have to push my vehicle to my home and raised a service request, ola took close to 5 days to tow my vehicle after I made several calls to their call center, on the service front. I have not got any update even after 10 days, I am following up with the ola call center daily and end up getting all false promises from the agents, I still haven't received my vehicle...It's really frustrating. I don't recommend this product as it is not mature enough to handle a better consumer experience.",OLA S1,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Buying experience.
I booked the scooter for September 2021. The initial promise was that the scooter will be delivered by December.
Well, that never happened. Then ola changed the date to Jan. I paid the full amount in Jan and waited for the scooter. My scooter delivery was supposed to happen before 31st Jan as per the confirmation (this is after multiple changes on the delivery date). Nevertheless, in Feb also nothing gets changed either on the app or in real-time. I did not get any calls or messages from the team.
Month : march:
Nothing changes. No scooter, no delivery, no calls. I tried canceling my scooter. But ola denied cancellation stating the invoice was generated.
Month: April :
Here I am, nothing changes. No delivery, no calls. No cancellation is possible. Ola cheated on my money.
Month may:
Again, the same response from ola. ""we are prioritizing your case"". My insurance is already active (losing money there). My finance EMI already started (losing money there too). And all they say is we will get back to you.
My suggestion to all those good people who get brainwashed by ola through fake advertisements, "" please please please don't buy this"". You really don't want to go through the frustration that I am going through.",OLA S1,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
It's so amazing electric scooter i like to have this scooter it's have long battery life it has long range this scooter is filled up with new and amazing features like touching control accurate button position this scooter ha large boot space it comes in fascinating colour and the shape of the scooter is futuristic liked it a lot,OLA S1,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Best bike for indian customer for this segment. Very comfortable and tubeless tyre are best performance. Boot space is very good, it is a best value for money product in this segment.",OLA S1,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
"Booked it and waited for 7 months. Still no update. Came to see the user review here and saw 4.5 stars. After reading the reviews i came to know that none of them had even never seen the scooter in person. This rating method is funny. Even myself who didn't own it can submit a review, that's funny.
I just cancelled for the reason, it has a huge hump in the floor. The main reason we buy a scooter is, it can accommodate things in the floor, but you can't do it in ola, because things will not sit properly in the floor because of the hump.
Even the storage area can accommodate only half sized helmets as proved by some youtube channels.",OLA S1,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Buying has been a hassle. Placed order and am still waiting for news of the company delivering the bike.
No test ride. No first look. Overall looks like a mega scam. The videos that are circulating on youtube also are not something that gives confidence in the product. The advertisement was really flashy. That's all.. Everything else seems to be a scam. Better go for Ather Bajaj or TVS. They promise and deliver.",OLA S1,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,2
"Excellent, will take away market from Ather , Bajaj who were doing well in sales ,Ola has nailed with features, range ,speed and yes!! Price.

Again new time slot also website crashed. Again waiting for new date and time for booking. Hope so will be delivered as early as possible",OLA S1,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"It was very early to comment on it, but for now if we look on paper ola will give tough competition to Bajaj, and Ather.

"Recently booked s1 pro midnight blue for daily commute of avg. 22 kms. Already had activa 2005 model - still rough n tough. Second one is activa 125 - super smooth ride. Awaiting for Chetak ev but till the date not available in gujarat. Looks wise still prefer Chetak for its old charm classy look. But now ola has change the entire game by future rich technology they provide with these two newer version of scooter. In metro city there might be a bit problem of charging because of high rise and flat system but hyper charge stations comes first to them only. S1 pro promises the riding range of about 180 km on paper. As average daily commute of 22 kms for full 7 days considering we may require only max once in a week or more charging. So no problem of inconvenience.
Battery life is definitely extended in above mentioned scenario. Company claims 6-7 years of battery life so no issues at all. Many features comes very first time in two wheeler segment which definitely appealing youth. Myself is convinced by the software part of the scooter. Let's hope the best about hardware part. Because the company itself has a prominent in software space not in hardware. Let's give atleast a try once.",OLA S1,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,4

"This scooter looks very good. I like the parts design and it gives good range in one charge. Whenever I buy the scooter I will choose this scooter only.
Best option is to shift to electric vehicles. I also think that our future vehicles are electric. It also helps decrease pollution. It is also good for our nature. In my opinion there is only one con in our country which is very low electric stations. That is only cons. I think.",OLA S1,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

Ola s1 is the one of the most awaited scooter in India. I hope it will launch soon. Not so expensive as price and good looking. It has a very good mileage per charge. It's around 124 km per single charge. It's a future bike. It is the best scooter for the students. And it's not heavy compare to other bikes & scooters. Then i would like to go with ola s1.,OLA S1,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Best in class EV scooter. As compared to other EV, prices are also low and has more power.",OLA S1,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Worst experience after buying these ola s1 pro ev scooters.
Twice my ola scooter stopped suddenly on road after a message I got on the scooter screen that the battery drained. And this even when the scooter screen was showing battery life remaining for 50 kms.
As the battery is not detachable, you will be troubled and have to tow away this scooter due to unreliable manufacturing defects and the worst ola scooter support service as they never reply to your complaints.
Think many times before purchasing these scooters as worst customer support and unreliable battery life.",OLA S1,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Ola should call the ola should call back the entire supplies. Ola is pushing products without addressing the issues. I booked the scooter way back in August 2021, and the delivery was made in Feb. 2022. The total amount paid is 142000+. The bills are available for approx rs.120000/-. No proper response for the difference. The initial offer of 181kms per charge is revised to 135/-kms after delivery. The actual mileage is less than 100kms. Never depend on the mileage shown in the display. One day, depending on the displayed mileage of 32kms, I took the vehicle. It stopped on the road with zero charges.

If the vehicle is fully charged and not used for a few days, it will continue to show full charge mileage of 135kms whereas it would have consumed more than 10%per days and the actual available mileage is maybe 40 kms.

"Bad experience
Bad experience I had with my ola s1 pro. The battery gets drained, even though showing a 50 km range balance on the scooter panel. Due to the battery not being detachable, I have faced lots of inconveniences as had to tow this scooter.
Ola customers get a salary even if they are only sleeping and never reply to customers' grievances and complaints.
Ola should stop manufacturing these scooters as it is not their cup of tea. Only harassing customers by selling their faulty scooters.",OLA S1,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

"I have experienced a worst services provided by the ola Coimbatore region. They were cheating the customers by giving false beliefs. When i know that i have been cheated by the company they convinced me and ask me to put a mail, still now no reply has been received. And also the product that ola s1 pro has been delivered to me. The become worse within the 10 days from the date of delivery which is driven less than 560 kms. They said road assistance will be provided at once you needed . But i got the road assistance more than after 16 hrs. from time that made a complaint. The cheating company ola better shutdown their business instead of giving false belief and worst product to the people..",OLA S1,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

Chasing bounce infinity e1 after paying the full amount for delivery and still not able to case the bounce, as they keep bouncing the date after date after date for their vehicle delivery. As per the company communication, the delivery across 7 states in India started on April 18th. And they asked for full payment from the customer for selected colors — red & black. As they are only producing these 2 colors because of the demand. The customer went ahead and change the color from grey to black so that it will be easy for the company to do the delivery without any hassle, still, it keeps bouncing, after all, it’s bounce infinity so it tends to bounce. And the customer has to wait for another bounce. Even after 12–15 calls to their customer support, they don’t have access to customer booking IDs or details and keep asking every time. So-called customer care doesn’t even know the dealer details in the Maharashtra region, as per customer care they are yet to finalize the dealer in Pune.

Looks are good and performance is also ok.
Servicing and maintenance
Worst service. No service center available near me and if go to a service center which is 10km distance from my location then they always need complete day to do service and also the quality of service and parts used are very bad.
Item replaced at the time of service again stops working in 1 day and on next visit service center need charges for same issue.
No way to contact any heads, no one pick call when contact on customer care number.
Tried to talk on chat but they are saying use website and submit feedback but they don't know where is the option of giving feedback.

Ridden 45km and still has two bar battery , guess it will go upto 55km for sure Don't know about maintenance since its less than 30 days but i think this is a killer scooty at the cost 58.5k on-road in kolkata with 3 years warranty for all the main components ..And running cost being cut down to 70 paise/km including battery cost ..And pollution free..Just a go commute.",Hero Electric Flash,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

4) Servicing and maintenance is always ready. As soon as you reach the showroom they will say some parts are broken which is not in warranty and ask you to pay, costly to maintain this bike.

That's because a lithium ion battery should not be charged 100 percent and should not be drained completely. I let the bike roll as much as it can and I use the throttle sparingly. Look wise the bike has a lovely cute look. I love it. Till now no maintenance. At 100 km's approx. per charge, I will get back my investment in maximum 1 year.

It was an astonishing experience for me to note that the vehicle fell silent and in stand-by mode at the signal till i accelerated... And the pick up was immediate! an ideal machine for in-town move-abouts. Your ads could be more aggressive. People could be weaned away from the false idea of meaningless speed, wastage of power and money - and the consequent inevitable 'eco-pollutions'...It will be wonderful if its range per charge could be enhanced. I have some innovative ideas for the same. I would be happy to offer my experience & expertise to conduct/ guide some projects in this regard for the company. Kindly contact me in this regard if you think it would be useful...",Hero Electric Flash,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
"I bought this bike(lead) in june 2019 at 41,000(maybe costlier than now)it is good in looking but it's body is totally plastic. According to me it can't handle more than 130-150 kg of weight for the speed. If you are buying then be careful while driving, i met with an small accident and the condition of the bike was worst due to its plastic body. And one more thing it takes around 8-9 hrs for charging and last till just 30-45 km(not more than that according to me). When it was new there was no footrest for keeping legs but now may be company is allowing.Well it's maintenance is not that hard just to charge and keep it clean. But i recommend to take it to service every 2-3 months because it may cause some break issues. Otherwise this bike is amazing and you will be feeling happy to drive this.",Hero Electric Flash,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,3

"After full charge, it's only run 35-40 km, while driving nonstop. On fly over it become very difficult to drive as is comes on speed 10 on a single person ride, battery cost is also high, which is likely 36000 for 1 battery. No pick up.

Informed dhanya motors and they sent mechanic very next day. And resolved the issue. As per them it was resolved. The moment their mechanic left the house , issue started again. Used the vehicle for 3 days with out light and indicator due to urgency. Informed dhanya motor again to rectify , they have taken back the vehicle to check. As per them the issue was due to loose connection and they want me to pick up the bike from work shop..... Why should i pick up the bike from their work shop? They are not sure whether issue has been addressed or not. They want me to check and take. I said no... Last 3 days it is lying in the show room.

"Recently i have purchased a magnus ex bike from Indore and after using it i have some feedback for this bike,
1. There should be an option with a 12-inch tire size as roads are very poor in our area and 12-inch tires increase the ground clearance for bikes. As per our area road conditions minimum of 155+ mm, ground clearance is required.
2. Seat is not fitted correctly on boot space, have checked many bikes at the dealer showroom, looks like the seat lock will be damaged after using the bike for one or two months. Feels a very low-quality part of the entire bike, even sometimes boot space light keeps on after closing the boot space because the seat is not fitted properly.
3. When we apply break on speed breaker, the bike suddenly stops and then has to again push the accelerator and the bike moves ahead with a jerk.
4. Charger pin which we insert into the battery can be better if someone does not point the pin correctly and try to push in the battery in that case charger pin can be damaged.
5. Okay with a 3-year warranty for the bike's main components, but distance should be increased for warranty condition, expecting 35,000+ km's warranty instead of 20,000 km as per the price and range of the bike.
Have few more points but these are the main problems with this bike which should be resolved as soon as possible if these problems are solved then it will be a rough and tough bike for all types of indian conditions and users. Bike's look is very good.",Ampere Magnus EX,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,3

"Such a nice choice to go for it. Superb pickup and smooth driving experience even in traffic. I used to drive daily for 60 kms. The battery lasts for 70 km in city mode but in eco mode it lasts for 89 kms to be precise. My suggestion is the wires need to be properly consoled. Many wires are just exposed to naked or not secured to the body walls. Seat plastic quality needs to be improved. Range to be increased to 100 in city mode.

2. Scooter is delay in instant acceleration. When break is released it needs 1 second to move forward. One flat roads riding is ok. When we want to stop in height area we need to apply break and give acceleration, this wont work this will give bad experience.
3. Reaches to 60k in speed when high mode but there may 10-15% jump in speedometer. Getting 100+ range which is good thing.
4.I don't see any change in current bill. Company said 2 units for full charge.
5. Need to improve pickup issue.",Ampere Magnus EX,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
For a mid priced electric scooter this is a good choice.. But problem arises when we apply brakes on riding up a surface. Because of the one-second delay in acceleration.

Disadvantage:
The leg keeping area height is more which causes to bend our legs and hence we need to bend our back bone. This causes severe pain in long rides.

"The buying process was simple since I made full payment even though it took 19 days to deliver because of color availability.
Pros: frond look wise it's pretty good and we cannot make out its ev from the front side
Boot space is decent we can keep the half helmet.
Cons: 121 km is just a dream...The actual range is 80 with a single person and low mode. If we are riding pillion then max rage would be 50 to 60
Tyre's profile is 10 inches and the worst quality... No disk brake was given and braking efficiency is poor.
Speed is a big concern..Max speed is 50. You cannot overtake any petrol scooter on road ..40 to 47 is the max speed... If you want to reach 50 then u have to struggle
Charging time 5 to 6 hours..It's quite long and no fast charging option
Made quality is average...Within 1-month usage, starter switch was damaged..Even low/high mode switch made with 20 rs plastic.
People were attracted by the look and the company claimed 121 range...Plz don't believe that word that's never got it ...After buying dealer told me about the actual range ... If you want to get 100kn that's possible by riding one person and a speed of 25km... Instead of that, we can buy sports gear cycle.",Ampere Magnus EX,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,4

2. Battery charging & storage shall be displayed with the percentage in the front display panel.

2. Very smooth to ride. Good torque. High pick up in high mode. Balance good. Good speed control options with high and low modes. Battery backup is great. The low mode can give around 100 and the high mode 80 km. Excellent commute vehicle. Looks like activa but actually longer. Has more legroom left for 6feet tall person. Two people can comfortably ride this scooter. Can ride in rains. It will also perform when waterlogging is low.
Servicing required as per km driven. Can tolerate Indian road conditions with minimum service. Looks very good on the road. Not like a typical electric scooter.
Cons - Loading over 150 kg can slow the vehicle down especially when moving up a bridge. The battery takes longer to charge. No fast charge option(but at this price ok). Build quality is good but when you compare to petrol scooter of the same price then not up to the mark. Better build than hero optima and ola.

"I bought this scooter 2 monoths back for my daily commute of nearly 54km. The buying experience was average but what I like most is they call once in nearly 2 weeks to enquire about any problems with the scooter.
I get an average of nearly 84km per charge and charging takes about 5 hours. I use it in both high and low-speed modes (mostly high-speed).
The looks of this bike are almost like honda activa and are comfortable to ride. You get a boot space that accommodates my full helmet.
A few things that can make it better are a more comfortable seat and a better build quality. But overall I am happy with the performance till now at 600km.",Ampere Magnus EX,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,4

"I bought this scooter in November 20 in Jabalpur (MP). My daily commute is around 30-35 kms. With the speed and pickup, there is no compromise when compared to other petrol heads.
The top speed is 55 km/h, and battery lasts for around 85 kms.
This vehicle is very light to ride, weighing just 87 kg.
Suspension and balancing of the vehicle is good. Just as other scooters.
Charging of the vehicle takes 4 hours for a full charge and around 1.5 units (around Rs.12)
Looks of the vehicle is just awesome, this is an eye turner for everyone. Everyday 3 to 5 strangers asks about the performance, pricing and praise the vehicle.

"Having owned a new type of automobile gives a thrill but all got drained when i was riding amidst a busy traffic.
It is so silent; it does have initial grunt or a kind of adrenaline induced jerk that all make proud. The handling is quite nimble but the ride quality is bumpy due to its skinny tyres.
Certainly after making a trip to market or so, it feels happy that i didn't spent lavishly in a petrol bunk. In contrast, as there is no indicator for warning us how much distance that it can commute, it gives a little fear that whether would it make it pull manually to home back.
Two things need to be addressed soon. The in-between acceleration must be increased, otherwise, it will definitely let you on the middle of the road.
Next one is the need of a meter to intimate us how much kilometers it has remaining to bring us back to home. As of now no greater cribs. Kudos to hero!",Hero Electric Photon,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,3

"Buying experience:- within 20 days, vehicle got registered and delivered
Riding experience:- turning radius is too much, which creates problem during turning. This bike is not suited for roads, which is having potholes. Shock absorber performance is not that good, due to which, back pain will affect rider. Even if company promises top speed of 45km/h, but this is without a rider. With a rider weighing 70kg, speed goes down to 40km or below.
Looks and performance:- look is not that good, because, battery can be seen from rear tyre side. Seat height of vehicle is less than that of activa. Since maximum speed scooter can deliver is only 45km/h, so one can't overtake which moves at 40km speed.
Servicing:- actually no major service is required for the vehicle, even though, to pay some amount to the dealer, paid service intervals added in periodic services.
Pros and cons:-
Pros:- powerful electric scooter at lower price. This electric scooter good for ladies. Suitable for travel on flat good roads
Cons:- not suitable for tall men. Even not suitable for men, who require some speed and want to overtake a vehicle. Will feel back pain during long rides. Turning radius is more. Some times at full accelerator throttle, scooter moves half of its half maximum speed. We need to decrease the throttle and the increase it, then only it achieves maximum speed.",Hero Electric Photon,NA,NA,3,NA,NA,NA,NA,3

"Review will be quite bigger but its worth it, i hope,I strongly believed in hero electric , but bit disappointed on the vehicle i got, due to some problems in it. But will keep updating whether it got rectified or not & also the bikes performance in diff timelines in upcoming months.I bought this bike, hero electric photon (li model) on 10/11/2018 in erode dealership, but they delivered from another dealer due to stock unavailability. In hero electric showrooms i visited, all the staffs are decent and speaks/behaves well with customer. But they lack deep knowledge about the bikes they sell. Lesser than what i got to know while researching on choosing a good e-scooter. Also, most of the dealers don’t have vehicles for test drive(especially photon not for display also, they don’t have stock itself). This is a bigger disadvantage for both company and customers. I went to 4 dealers in 3 different cities chennai (2 dealers), erode, trichy but they don’t have stock of photon li/photon itself.I preferred photon li model for its detachable lithium ion batteries. But its too difficult to remove batteries from vehicle. The seat plastic, covers the battery power pin/socket, so its difficult to remove the pin and lift battery. It is a major shock for me, if there was a test drive vehicle or display vehicle i would have got to know about it earlier and would have opted for some other vehicle. But i saw the vehicle for first time on delivery day only. If you are staying in apartment/ place without proper electric connection boxes in parking, then don’t opt this bike (till there is an updated version where they rectify this) as it is so difficult to remove batteries and charging it inside your home. You have to charge it with vehicle only.Then, the bike i took have following problems which disappointed me hugely. I believed in hero electric. It might be basic or small issues but facing it on first day, that too when u r travelling from dealership to home on first ride. Its so bad. Problem 1: dealership to my home is 60 kms(nearby districts). In middle of journey first battery got over and we switched to second one using the switch given under seat for changing battery from 1 to 2. After which bike didn’t started, for nearly 15 mins we struggled in middle of road and it started off by itself. Same problem occurred on day 3 also while switching from 1st battery to 2nd. Again struggled in middle of road for 20 mins Problem 2: suddenly sometimes motor is not working on acceleration. Everything else is working, from horn, headlight, indicators all are working. But if i accelerate, there is no power to motor, vehicle is not moving. I checked brake also, its not locked and brake light is off only. It happened 7 times in 3 days. In middle of road, in traffic, near home in different circumstances.Problem 3: i observe sound is coming while i stop accelerating or if i brake, its not from motor and not due to friction in tyres. But from front disc i hope. Its odd, in an electric vehicle on my first ride, a strange uncomfortable sound.Apart from these, a connector is not mounted, battery level indicator is not accurate, battery charged fully then also adapter showing red light, i have to unplug and plug again to check whether its full or not. Upon unplugging and plugging back its turning to green if charged. Adapter also have problem i hope. Remote alarm/lock ll serve only as anti-theft alarm, don’t expect more in it. Storage space below seat is bit less compared to petrol scooters, due to batteries occupying the space. Quality, look & mechanism of the plastic separator that separates battery and storage space under seat is not good. Quality of plastics used have to be improved a bit.Pros: 1) bike’s look is good. Its simple and decent.2) its really comfortable to ride, seats are spacious, foot space is good, easy to handle, less weight. Riding comfort is good, can be compared with top selling petrol bikes.3) head light is good enough.4) indicator can be turned off by a centre switch in indicator button which made t easier.5) smooth ride, no noise/vibration ( exception :my defective vehicle)6) speed and pick up is good compared to other evs. Can zip through city traffic easily. Achieves 50 kmph in flat or downside roads. 40 to 45 while climbing up (like flyovers). If compared to petrol counterparts, its bit downside in terms of pickup and speed. But more than enough for town or city commutes. 7) with two riders also its performance is good.(though there will be slight change,only slight). It can go up to 40 to 45 kmph with two riders in flat roads & 30-35 kmph with two riders while climbing up (like flyovers)8) braking is good, as supply will cut off once u apply brake. So braking quick and good. finally, keeping the problems in my bikes aside (hoping that these problems occurred only in my bike) , its a good choice as of now for city , town or less distance commutes. One main thing hero electric need to update in this model is making its battery removal easier. But we have to check the vehicle thoroughly before taking delivery to avoid facing problems as mine. So that you wont regret your decision on buying it, as everything else is fine/manageable except battery removal. coming to my bike: i don't know how such a faulty vehicle(which i got) was allowed till delivery. Do they (hero electric) have any quality checks or preventive measures for such cases. Expecting a mechanic in a day from dealership as promised by them. Ll update after they service the vehicle.",Hero Electric Photon,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,2

"I found equal merits and demerits in Okinawa Praise Pro.
Pros:-
-Front Space
-Good pickup
-Satisfactory speed ( Actual 55-60)
-Range- Never expect more than 80km (actual) in any case.
-Comfortable seating
-Full charge timing:- Never took more than 3.5 hrs.
Cons:-
-Worst part of okinawa scooters are Speedometer or Odometer ( It shows 10km more than actual speed and consequently it counts the trip kilometres.
2. There are two horn switch. None of the switch loaction is as per your thumb.
3. Range could be better as I was expected 100km (actual)
4. Central Government Subsidy looks like Scam. Company assured that they have reduced those subsidy from Ex-show room as shown on the website. Thus, cost of the Model Praise Pro is approx 90k in Delhi. This is little expensive as compared.

I don't know what they do in servicing, asking us to leave the vehicle for 3-4 days resolve no problem ,but charge for servicing like they did a great work. Such a bastard people.. This vehicle or i should say company is pure waste of money and time. At last i request people if they are thinking of buying an electric bike or scooter, please go for any other company but not for this because they'll cheat you till the world's end...",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

"I had purchased from bhagabat motors, bhubaneswar on nov 2018 the lead acid model. 1) the show room puts mixing with two different brand batteries. 2) after 1 year it runs only 12000kms and battery gone. Lead acid battery cost 36000/- without warranty, but not available. 3) when you fully open the seat, it touches the horn switch and it sounds. Speedometer and odometer both are fake, showing higher value. 4) my back disk break, the rotor rubbing with break pads, which is a manufacturing defect, but the show room engineer ignore the issue. 5) it is so heavier that, unable to put with the double stand. Finally i can say you may go with electric vehicles but not from okinawa.",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

Now when talk about it performance it was superb,( not as racing)Is has good capacity to take load, speed is easy going to 65-70 on single rider. In about comfort is some problem for tall man( for 5.9 ft to above),now come come to maintenance, i truly tell u that i use it very hardly and after two companies services, i never go to service company even that i never change any parts and batteries.

Buying was great beautiful experience. Riding experience is also great because of the look of the vehicle is awesome and some times it is amazing to drive and more over mo servicing and maintenance cost. So if you are planning to buy the ride just go for it no second thought and no cons as such the more ride the more you love.,Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

I feel its completely cheating.. When i bought, they said.. For 3 yrs you can use with out any problem in batteries. But now, reality is totally different.. I have spent almost 70k and now after 1.3 yr, they asking to upgrade to lithium ion with 46k.. Now the bike is useless.. I am planning to buy some petrol scooter again. For lithuim ion, now they are telling, it will work for 5 yrs without any issues though 3 yr warranty is given..

I bought the scooter in October 2018 i have driven 10000 kms battery is just worked for accurately 1 year and the battery was gone, we want to change New battery the cost is too high normal battery price is 35000/- and the lithium ion battery price is 45000/- petrol scooter is better than any electric scooter.",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
The dealers are poorly equipped with servicing training and they don't have spares. My charger stopped working since the last 10 days and the dealers don't have spares to provide it to customers. My bike is lying idle since 10 days. Usb is fitted on the exterior of the bike it gets spoilt in the rains and no spares to fix it again. I bought it from greenlife pune baner the dealers is pathetic on all fronts.,Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Hi,I have been using this bike for 8 months.I use it daily for going to office approximately 45 kms. In 8 months more than 3 times the indicator,front light and horn stopped working and the servicing also is very bad,every time they change it,it works for a month again it stops working.As they have mentioned in the scooter details it goes for 70 kms on full charge but it’s not true. It goes 50 kms maximum. Taking doubles is impossible in the vehicle because it goes very slowly and the rider feels heavy while riding.Taking doubles for long distance is impossible.I have had horrible experience like the vehicle goes off all of a sudden because the battery cannot take more weight. I recommend you all to think wisely before buying this scooter.Thank you.",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Don’t buy okinawa ,it s my personal opinions because i am owner of okinawa ridge (licenced type) what all the specification they are telling is wrong. They as telling 70 km mileage @ 55 km speed. Its all wrong .The speed 55 km what they are mentioning in the meter is originally 50 only( meter is also wrong) i was getting initially 55-60km mileage only ( in all the mode eco/sort..But they are saying 70 km).I bought the vehicle 14-08-2018, after 3 months my mileage is going down to 40-45 km even after the service also.At the end of the six months battery down and the mileage reduce to 20-25( means one full charge i am getting only 25 km.)i complaint to the dealer rapid motor in kerala,they change one battery only( but i am sure that 2-3 batteries are weak. They discharged and charged again Even changed the battery also i am getting only 40 km mileage !!!! ( instead of 60-70 what they are telling). When its complete one year and 3 months suddenly the battery done and i am getting only 10-15 km( believe it!!! it is true!!!!) when i approach the dealer rapid motors kerala thrissur, they denied to change the batteries because the warranty is over!!!! now i am running my okinawa with the mileage of 15-20 only!!!! that means…if you buy okinwa at rs 60000 you should keep 15000 after one year for weak batteries…..(my all green thoughts has changed…",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
I paid 81000 on road and was happy in paying that amount until reality stuck. Within a month of usage it started giving problems. And now a visit to service center happens every 2 weeks. I feel really low quality components are used to build this bike and it has not gone through any quality checks. Please don't buy it. You'll waste your money and have an additional headache while driving it.,Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"After sale there is no maintenance of this fake company, if we got any problems dealers will not respond, they are arrogant, behavior is worse. fake speed meter, parts are very delicate, seating position is worst, shock absorbers are not working front and back you will get spine related problems very easily. I got spine problem also, ban okinawa in India as its a fake company",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
The price of parts like brake shoes is very high and got torn off after running only 3000km. The maintenance like repairing of other parts like mcb is uncomfortable and ordinary and also pillion footrest and shock absorber rear is also ordinary. Very poor and never recommend on such ordinary toy-like parts.,Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
Battery replaced in 6 months but also only 40 km per charge giving no warranty for a charger all ready 2 chargers gone worst service.,Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Worst after-sales service. If your bike gets malfunctioned then consider that your bike will take at least a month.. The same happened to me, they don't have spare parts which is the worst part. Contacted customer care service.. No response.. Contacted regional officer of theirs.. Just gave false hope.. Same condition. Made contact every day, every day they said the part which is malfunctioned they are not getting their spare, everyday new reason was told. It's been more than 12 days... Still the same... Without bike",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
Best scooter as compared to petrol bike . All feature working are best . Look and performance is awesome. All electric scooters pickup are the best. All electric scooters bike are available in reasonable price with reasonable maintenance all over India have dealership and showroom available so this is the famous brand in electric scooter.,Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"This might be a bit long.
Okinawa is the china set for scooter. They should rebrand themselves as sigmatel.
This is a cheap chinese scooter rebranded as indian, the charger and internals are written in chinese. Why tell lies, if it's made in china say so, why the subterfuge. It's most likely manufactured in china and assembled in India. This is like old tech 2014-15 hero electric kind of scooter. So much for make in India and boycott china.
Weak plastic body is see-through in sunlight, poor headlight visibility is barely 10 meter in dark it's dangerous to ride this as potholes or people aren't visible. The disk brakes are bad and it's constantly rubbing eating battery and brake pads.
Lead acid battery lasts 6000kms only costs 30k to replace, lithium ion battery is also very bad, they are using old lithium cells which fail after the warranty is over.
The service center is the worst, most of the time they are closed, and they get commission for servicing the scooter by tearing out the coupons and sending them to okinawa without actually servicing any scooter. Okinawa you're cheating and also getting cheated. They are using children as mechanic that is not just unethical but also illegal as they are working with 70 volts dc which is dangerous. No warranty or repair possible because dealers only sell it and don't know how to service it. The company doesn't care for its image as it's only cares about selling more and more.
Mr okinawa is a fool if he thinks he'll get rich by doing this . Tighten up your ship sir. Here's some business advice from a loser to an idiot, how does hero exist today? huh? is it because of its amazing engineering? exquisite build quality, best in class performance? nope none of those. Hero or formerly hero Honda was and is successful because it could be fixed easily and readily even though they made crap, that crap was cheap crap and that cheap crap can be easily fixed by buying some cheap crap and replacing the crapped crap part and you're good to go on your crappy bike on the crappy road to the other crappy part of this crappy country. They didn't just sell the bikes and bolted. They made service center everywhere. Even in the craphole town I call home there are 3 hero showrooms nearby and one Honda showroom but you Mr. okinawa sold about 10-15 scooters here then shut shop and went abracadabra. I can't get my front brake pads replaced so i now await my death or someone else's death because i can't have front brakes anymore. Also no rear brake warning light because life is short so okinawa policy is to make it even shorter unlike people from okinawa who live very long lives, yes I've read your bullshit business man bites from various auto media outlets.
If Mr. okinawa wants to remain in the market it'll have to improve its manners and mindset of providing proper after sales service and spares and repair, make battery station etc or okinawa will be nothing but a sigmatel, china set owners will recognize that name.
Service center is denying warranty for rear brake light switch and saying i will have to fix it elsewhere. How indian government is allowing such malpractice against consumer and buyers is appalling.
The hub motor is weak and only capable upto 50 km/h max. But the speedo shows 70 plus hilarious. The motor bearings used are so cheap that it got bent during running and now the wheel wobbles and rubs with the disc brake pads.
Fake speedometer and odometer shows exaggerated numbers.
Charging the lead acid battery takes 7 hours minimum. The lithium also takes surprisingly long about 4-5 hrs.
Battery capacity meter is also wrong doesn't show range left or energy left. There is no bms so it can go boom during charging and running. There's no battery or motor cooling so they overheat during use.
Battery meter just shows 5 bars which shows full when standing and drinks completely when running.
Suspension is un-adjustable and extremely poor, front is too soft and sags completely on sitting one person and rear is too hard and has very low travel. The scooter weighs 170kg feels like handling a royal enfield on cycle tyres. The handle wobbles dangerously in speeds above 40kph on uneven roads.
they are asking 90k plus for this crap.
I lost more money on battery than saving on petrol.
If you want to throw away money buy this. After owning this scooter for 2 years i feel like a sigmatel china set owner.",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"I like to burn it with petrol. Okinawa's quality is absolutely bad. And its distributors do not even talk beyond their office hours. I think the customer is crazy.. I am very worried about this.

I have become mad twice in 15 days.",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

"I had bought the Okinawa praise model in January 2019 which was given to me by the dealer for 82000. From this it is known that the company has no control over the dealer. Dealers can rob the customer as much as they want from their mind. Since then the mileage of the bike was not as much as it is told. If we are 10 km. When the bike is running, its meter shows 13 to 14 km and the bike does not give an average of more than 100 km.
Even after showing all these faults, the dealer did not do any solution. After that, told the company all the problems on the phone and also did email but the company also did not give any response. Tired of all this, i filed my complaint with the district consumer forum Aurangabad whose number is ( cc/606/2019)
And wow i won my case. And now my complaint state consumer forum Aurangabad is here and i am sure that the forum will understand my grievance and resolve it. If anyone has such a problem like me, then he should contact me, I will definitely help. Unless we go to the customer dispute forum, the company will not know about the customer's grievance.
You can make your own complaint in the customer disputes redressal forum. And it doesn't seem like any charge is completely free. If anyone needs any information, then tell me, mail me and I shall give full help to the troubled customer like myself and will give all the information even further..",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

My advice is do not buy until we have an effective judicial accountability system in place so as to protect consumers from this turncoat manufacturers as they bribe the politicians and the media and hype the product and entice the gullible Indian customer to buy and then when the product fails there is nowhere to go for the consumer and these consumer courts are in effective as the lawyers fix matters and you are left in the lurch.,Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,1,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

I bought this bike and change the battery (gel battery, Okinawa product) after driving for 7500 km.

"this scooty have Matt colour finish it's headlamp and body frame takes a sporty look but body graphics not likeable , suspension is good from any scooter suspension .
you all know that features key less entry , back gear(like back gear but not back gear just motor gave you minimum power to go back) , when your scooters side stand down scooter can't on ,EBS system ( not like abs but it's breaking system controlled bye electric system)
overall it's very good
this scooty get full charge at 7 hr
scooters tubeless tyres and bigger wheels.
this scooters have rear and front disc brake
but front disc very very big and strong, this disc break give you strong breaking .
its have two horns in two handle and horn is not good , Handling is very good.
but service centres not available in our city but it's servicing was dun in hero showroom and the owner tell me the servicing cost will less than petrol scooters around 100 or 200 maybe .
lead acid battery will stable for 2 yr .
this scooter I ride 15 or 16 km and I falls in love of this scooter and will get of this scooters lithium ion model bcz lithium ion stable 5000 charging circles and to low weight from led acid battery this battery in one time full charge give 200 kmc lead acid model not gave 160 kmc in economic mode.",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

Now april on words mileage reduced 100 to direct 50~55 km per charge .Now all most 3 to 4 battery is life gone .New battery cost is now around rs=25000.So one year u need maintenance cost 2500 .Worst ...I planing for save some money from ev scooter . Some regular maintenance also.Please don't purchase ev scooter .When newly ev scooter come sir it will go up to 300~400 recharge cycle. Till now i have traveled only 6020 km.If we calculate 50km per charge just i have complete around 110 cycle.As per company policy once warranty over all things is over .Battery is over .Now show room person telling sir lid acid battery life max one to 1.5 year only.Lid acid battery is not good .So you can go to lithium battery that cost around rs 65000 with 2 year warranty .Who knows after 2 year same lithium battery come problem .May be that time yearly change around rs30000/..Dear friend maybe this blog remove from internet from company.Please aware this as possible as ..Max people.,Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
The bike speed is awesome. Save more petrol .I am using this before 5 months .I love the speed . Smooth riding on off rodding. I use also out the city . When i full charged the bike ride upto 60 km continuously. I happy with this . Comfortable seats 2 people easily sit & travel upto 60km. Lighting is good.,Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
I am happy to buy this scooter . My daily running 50 km .In 10 months 10000 km runs.All thing is good.Low maintenance .I have think about battery life.Is it good or not .If it requires with in 20000 km then not benefits for me .More than 20000 is average .More than 30000 beneficial.Riding experience is good but not suitable for long distance.,Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

"Very bad, the bike doesn't run the km specified by the company and no after sales or road side services part are bad quality the battery, controller i had my replacement after lots of trouble and you are dependent on the dealers mechanic who have a very bad attitude and expensive i suggest don't buy inviting problems.",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"This scooter is not even worth of it's price of 76500, it has all this problems...1. Only goes 100-120 kms.2. Speedometer is full fake showing 72 km/h top speed but real gps speed is only 52-53km/h..3. Battery charge indicator is also useless never ever shows correctly. 4. Very very uncomfortable seat and riding posture.5. Useless headlights led is just fake not go even 20 meters of distance.. Hard to ride at night.6. It's weight is terribly 170kg+ and vibrates alot at any potholes or speed breakers.I haven't yet seen any of the good quality in this scooter...I'll never suggest anyone to buy it... Its useless and money wasting scooter..",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
Service is worst.I suggest to avoid this purchase.Battery life is not at all good and company does not have any inventory.Avoid it. Don't buy it.Chassis are broken it's very shocking.So called alloy wheels are broken in run.One if worst battery life.Not at all beneficial.Company is not all trust worthy.,Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Odometer is showing higher speed than actual speed. Maximum speed is 55km against company claim of 75km. Maximum mileage per charge is 100km to 110km against company claim of 175 km. Not suitable for ride in the night, since the headlights are very poor. Distance between handle to seat is too lengthy comparing with activa or access, it gives pain to hand, in the long drive ie above 20kms. Horn and light switch are placed different places compared with other scooters, so we have to struggle in the initial days. Seat length is comparatively less. Foot stand is in high position.",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,2

Lots o pros & cons. Is described below Pros:1.Visually awesome.2.Stunning looking.3.Lower price comparatively. 4.Full charge gives 100 km.5.Economically good.6.3 hrs. Charge gives ready for 60/70 km.Run.7. Battery quality is quite good.8.Boot space is good.Helmet easily keep on the inside space.9. Battery hide under middle of bike and protects from raining.10.Good performance and design.Cons.1 maintenance infrastructure still not up to date.2. Mileage should get more per charge.,Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
It's good but main problems related to maintenance. Whenever problems in bike no service available easily so bike should be take place on your risk two time i have facing this problem it's take 5 to 7 days to repair also 1 battery changed in two month battery capacity weak in two month it's gives 100km in single charge.,Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,3
"Ride is bumpy like riding camel.175 km per charge is false. It seems testing done on machine not on road.Sitting arrangement for driver is worst. Adaptation of all controls like horn , blinker is worst.Suspension is worst experience just line riding bicycle. Loss of money. Worst experience.Look is good and performance is worst. I am worried for battery life.",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"After taking test ride of hero and tunwal i felt okinawa praise was better than all those. Actually i wanted to buy a good looking scooter with good mileage and non of them are providing the same except okinawa praise.1. Buying experience:I bought the vehicle from sai enterprises, dhalapathar,khurda,odisha. Dealer was very helpful and was very straight forward in mentioning all the pros and cons. The total amount i paid was rs76000 for double disc brake one. 2. Riding experience:To be honest for 1-2 days i felt very awkward while driving bcoz of soundless and then finally loved it. On bumpy rides its not giving very much comfortable ride experience but in main road it's giving fine experience. I ride it daily for 80kms. Braking system is amazing with double disc.3. Details about looks & performance:I bought the glossy purpule colour and it looks amazingly well and many people always states and asks me about the vehicle mostly bcoz it's very eye catching.Charging time is actually 8-9 hours and in single charge it's giving 140kms. I have tested it and in manual also it's written maximum 150kms , so maybe 200km is for lithium version.4. Service & maintenance: Haha actually i have not gone a single time for any service but yes availed the free service by them twice , just battery rotation and few adjustments.Maintenance is actually zero in it and i'm saving a lot of fuel cost.5. Pros and cons:Pros: saves me daily rs100 and early rs36000 , in two years i will get my money back by this which is amazing.In single charge goes for 140kms with speed of 60kms that is my speed .Zero maintenance and no need to visit service centre and no need to change engine oil like that.Look is classy and with keyless start and locking and theft protection including mobile charging it's really good.Only takes 3 unit of electricity that is rs10 for my home metre. Cons : suspension not very good on bumpy roads.",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Worst experience, at initially i was excited to buy a drove this electric bike as a eco friendly person.However , come to personal experience The build quality of bike is poor.Cons: Will start from front to rear of bike 1) head lights of bike are like a mobile screen light at high beam, at low beam no need to say.2)handle will shake on riding, due to it's non rigidity. This will not affect more but whenever we drive on rough road it would. May it cause accident if you don't drive care fully.3) come to ignition switch (power the motor) the build quality of switches are very poor. Horn switch was damaged in first week. But luckily it have two switches. These switches are bit different we cannot adapt initially to press because it's position it's a different matter.4)major part of bike is battery backup Company mentioned it will go until 150-200 km. Thats absolutely false. May they tested on treadmillIn reality it can go only 80-100 km. With a single person. If you rode dual on bike it's comes under 85km *(initially i tested). Depends on roads. But now it's giving me only Guarantee on batteries would be 1 year.The company of batteries are not a good one..4) this is the bad experience , after drove Later on front alloy wheel was broke-in in it's spokes and pivot joint where bike will contact with tire.This is the worst one i experienced. Virtually alloy wheels won't break it self. But here it's happen . Roughly my weight would be Let's imagine if a person with 70- 80 kg i shipped my bike in a trolley to show room in the middle of the road. I have snap shots of this.5) speedo meter will cheat you, it would showing 10km extra ex: if you are on a speed of 50 it will show 60. Again trapping by company .It won't go greater than 60 - 65 on a flat road and down slope. If it is a height slope it will go under 30 -356) front disk break is attractive but don't expect performance .I rarely used that break because of it's breaking mechanism. It won't control bike speed even if you on 20km speed 7)parts of the bike loosely coupled, never know which part will go off on running bike.8) seating experience is worst if you drove 50 km you will get tired due to it's height of the foot rest Pros:There is not much more 1) no fuel 2) less running cost (maintenance).3)eco friendly.4) bike will easily pull two persons As a electric engineer i have lot of to say but this is enough to understand about this bike Buy electric bikes but not from okinawa .",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

"Good:-

very sufficient for pocket as per petrol bike.

3.Look and is very good, performance is medium. Maximum speed is 55 km/h only but it will show 70 in odometer.
4.Not much services required, minimum level of maintenance cost if you use as a smooth riding. For rough riding (includes road condition) this ev is not recommended.
5.Saving bit amount of fuel cost but need to plan your trips and battery charging time accordingly.

"My nightmare started the day I purchased my scooter.. Initially when I complained of low range & screeching sound I was told that you are driving. Electric vehicle for first time so this problem is arising. and one was concerned even to check the vehicle. Then on second charge time I found the battery socket was broken .I was told it will be repaired n no replacement of battery for same. Then intermittently the scooter started giving problems. Most of the times it stopped running. The dealers don’t have spares & skilled technicians to do the trouble shooting. I had even complained at the okinawa company for the problem ,they assigned a engineer who was least bothered even to see what is the issue and just asked the technician to check. Till date the vehicle still fails they don’t have a solution for same. I purchased the vehicle from auto z showroom in dombivli, If you call company customer care they are least bothered.

"I have bought the okinawa praise 1.5 yr back. The mileage which they promised, while i bought was 140km per charge, if it is sport mode..120 km.. I never saw the promised mileage.. In reality the mileage would be 110 economic mode and 90 sport mode. When i complained about the mileage, initially they said, the battery needs atleast 10 cycles of charge, to give full mileage.. It almost went 100 cycles now.. There is no change in the mileage.. And one more thing, they promised is till 4 yr there will not be any performance drop. After 1.5 yr itself, i see drop in my mileage, despite regular service. .I really lost the trust in the okinawa scooters.. From the performance perspective..First 40 km of drive is comfortable..After that the speed performance gradually decreases.. I don't really recommend.. It needs lot of improvements.. I think..For a good electric bike..We need to wait for some more years..",Okinawa Praise,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,2
"Very very low-quality scooter.
I am completely not satisfied with the scooter and service.
1 - speedometer is totally false. If it shows 50 km/h speed, actually we are on 34 km/h speed. If the meter shows 100 km distance, actually it ran only 68 kms. The company has to call back all scooters and replace the speedometer.
2 - company says 80-90 kms per charge, it shows 90 kms per charge, but as the speedometer is faulty, your scooter ran only 60 kms per charge. So beware when you go for a 70-80 kms ride.
3 - disk breaks have noise issues. After 2 weeks I found some kind of noise from disc breaks. I went to a service station and different technicians gave me different conclusions. One said, in the rainy season, there is always noise coming from disk break. Another one said, all disc brake system in the world has noise, but in petrol scooters, it cannot be heard due to engine noise. What the rubbish technicians.
4 - sock absorbers are of very low quality. Cannot resist riding with a pillion. There is a strange kind of knocking noise from the rear shock absorbers..
5 - tubeless tyres - they are very poor quality. Once I was going with my wife and suddenly tyre got flat (no puncture). Maybe it left its grip on the drum.

Speed at 55 to 60 km/h. I am enjoying the scooter. Very good braking system. Overall its very good e scooter in 80k.,Ampere Magnus Pro,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"This is the best electric bike available in market.
I compared a lot of bikes and came to buy this.
The biggest benefit is providing good features at a reasonable price.
The scooter looks good and has a very similar look to activa or jupiter. Also the boot space is very big and helps to carry anything.
I am getting a range of about 80 kms in city driving and that's more than enough for an average daily commuter.
Ampere has a big chain of showroom and service centre throughout India and that makes it more dependable than any electric bike.",Ampere Magnus Pro,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

But with electricity bill you hardly pay 25-30k depending upon your usage.

"I bought my Magnus pro on the 8th of January this year. Other than the bad experience of inefficiency from the dealer’s side at the 45 time of the delivery of the vehicle, the vehicle is up to my likes. Certain demerits I would like to share about my Magnus pro are :1) The weight of the vehicle should have been a bit more than as of now because at turns, the scooter waves more than the desired angle of turn. 2) Then of course, the side & the center stand, it should have been installed with a bush punched on either stands. Because, when riding, both the stands tend to keep knocking on the chassis and gives an irritating noise especially at bumps. 3) the headlights could have been a little more powerful one. During rainfalls or when riding in a misty climate, your sight gets blurred as the led headlight even when on high beam does not have the required efficiency. I reported the same to a friend of mine and it was he who told me so that the headlight is been installed according to the battery capacity & hence I do not want to place it as a blame on ampere. 4) I happened to see the speedo cluster of the reo model ampere scooter. I was surprised to see a modern era speedo display cluster (totally multi - colored) installed on it. If the same had been been installed on Magnus pro, considering the price of Magnus pro, this product would have been an absolute hit. Other than this, I just feel lucky to be a proud owner of a Magnus. Pro. 3 cheers to ampere & greaves.",Ampere Magnus Pro,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

2- seat (dikki) have cracks and soon it will also break and i don't know how i will sit.
3- handle of the vehicle is with very bad quality - mirrors got broken from handle and it cannot be fixed even by welding as the quality of handle is very bad.

It is very suitable for daily city commuting. The vehicle has good looks and design and has all the basic feature that a 2 wheeler must have. One more myth about e vehicles is that it will not be able to climb steep roads. But I have tested in steep roads and while coming out of steep basement exit. Even though vehicle was stopped at the mid of climb, it managed to climb fully without any hassle. This scooter can do anything that a 110 cc scooter can do. But do keep in mind the battery charge level to avoid range anxiety. Some dealers are offering to exchange with petrol vehicles. I recommend to buy this vehicle if you have to travel within the city traffic. The dealer and the company both are oriented towards customer satisfaction. They respond to your requests immediately.

4) back wheel brake makes noise whenever I apply a brake.
5) cutting made to place the battery inside boot space looks like handmade using some excel blade looks so cheap.
6) front storage box is so weak I feel like within 1 year it will also start making noise on bumpy roads.
7) company logo ""pure ev 7g"" is pasted using double side tape, which feels so cheap.
8) battery holding box paint quality is so cheap.

11) overall all the materials used for manufacturing this product are not that good.
12) overall it looks like some 2 college graduates made this vehicle as project work, it doesn't look professional.

It easily get rust in bottom
Pros
Performance is ultimate comparing to other ev in India
Battery charging is 4 hours
Range easily it will give 90 km in type 3
Best for daily use
Cons
Quality of the body need to improve
So many indicators in dashboard and nothing works.

Not even your phone suit in the front space of the vehicle.",PURE EV EPluto 7G,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,4

"i had purchased the vehicle from richmond road show room. I had faced the below mentioned difficulties.
While taking the bike they spoke very nicely but after that the service was very poor and worst.
2.The vehicle is worst than any cycle. This much huge amount I have invested on this. I have not at all driven the kilometers upto 3000 km only.
3. Last three - 3 times the vehicle was towed from hosur Tamilnadu and every time the charges was Rs. 3000/- * 3 times total towing charges was Rs.9000/-. Every time they will tell a nice story behind that and I have done every thing for your vehicle. While driving to hosur for only 40 kms the mileage dropped immediately.

I bought pure 7g and after it was a hell like experience. I bought it from gaura Kondapur and the team is not worth for even a penny. They don't know even basic details about the vehicle and their after sale service is nightmare. There will be no proper support or service and the vehicle is downgrade quality from mirrors to back support handle. Their centre stand touches every speed breaker on the road. I don't know how they missed safety standards being a indian and Hyderabad made the considerable height of bumps on the road. They charged high amount for the quality provided and zero service and support. Company should take this seriously because dealers have already spoiled the brand image(i don't say it has got some brand value).

"Pathetic experience. The local supplier (shreekrishna enterprises, bandup mumbai) promised sky when i bought it. Within 3 months it started giving trouble with some sort of battery leakage, it was a nightmare to get the supplier to check the issue as they are super slow and don't care once you buy the product. They took battery set for check and replaced defective one with some old battery, while promising to replace that with new battery within 10 days as battery was still under warranty, it has been more than two months, they never replaced the battery. Within three months of use the mileage came drastically down to 25 km per full charging. I reported the issue to ampere company also, they didn't bother to address the issue, despite the fact that both the battery and bike is still under warranty.

"What a disappointment! the bike arrived after many months waiting (with various delivery dates not met.) I was unable to put it together in full working order as the wrong size screw had been supplied. My husband brought the correct screw the next day as I was eager to ride the bike. I also had concerns over a congealed substance on the hub. A replacement stand (which i was told was provided because the stand on the bike has problems) was broken. After the first 4km a high pitch noise came from the hub when in pedal assist 1 and 2 and continuously when free wheeling. I returned from my bike ride and called my supplier who assured me a representative from ampere would call that day. No call was forthcoming so i called the supplier again. 2 days later i spoke with an ampere rep who agreed it was probably a problem with the hub. I was asked to take off the back wheel, pack it and return it to them (they organized pick up) this was tuesday and i was told to expect it back on thursday. I contacted ampere on the thursday to check delivery and was told it would now be friday. Today (friday) i contacted my supplier as i had been waiting in for delivery of my back wheel but it had not arrived. They contacted ampere and i have been told its now saturday. The aftercare from ampere has not been good, i have a wheel less bike and have had to cancel plans.

First i was told that company is working to update the battery and soon it will happen in all the bikes. Got one date for that. After that, the new excuse was update got failed and it cannot be done for anyone. Then the next date with the new excuse was okinawa has now tied up with another battery company and then new date and i was told that soon you will get new battery.

"Buying was smooth, riding is ok because low suspension and thin fiber body, look and performance of battery is good, service is ok. Thin fiber body makes noise on uneven roads, Low suspension so have to be careful on humps, poor quality fiber and design for back wheel mudguard so got broken within 1500 km low speed drive. Center stand spring not good so it always jumps on uneven roads while driving, battery charging at home but have to charge 2-3 times with intervals to get full charge. Every time it shows it's fully charge but if you charge again after some time it takes charge. And with this trick it gives good range. Front light is so so in night to drive. Top speed is 55 when battery full charge. And will reduce to 50-51 if battery is charge less then 50%.Battery jumps a lot under the sit and the company belt is not good to hold it. With me 2 times it got broke. So last I did trick by filling stuff on top and side of battery which can hold it under the sit. But it's smooth on smooth roads, and gives 100 plus km range on one charge with driving less then 45. So good for daily city drive.

1. Water gets inside the switches, especially inside the high/low beam switch with make the headlight stuck in only high beam, and when I toggle the switch the odometer gets reset into zero. (I contacted the dealer and they replaced both the switch and the display unit but the issue persists.
2. The mcb in my scooter was defective and it constantly tripped. (dealer replaced it in a day)
3. The disk brake calipers is loose and makes sound while driving. (service tech told there is nothing that can be done about it)
I test drove both hero and pure ev and from the riding experience I felt pure is much better in refinement (hero jerks a lot while accelerating initially whereas ETrance offered much more refined and stable acceleration.)
Performance and look is satisfactory.
Don't know about servicing or maintenance needed yet.
Pros:
1.Good range
2.Sufficient performance needed in a city.
3. And anything else that you can find in youtube :p
Cons:
1. Low/no storage space (battery fills the space under seat.
2. Pillion comfort is not up to the mark but superb for single riding.
3. Inferior quality of materials and hardware.
4. Not rain friendly as i said earlier.
Overall I am satisfied with the vehicle but pure could've made it much better. Hope they'll listen to the feedbacks and improve in future...",PURE EV ETrance Neo,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
"Buying experience good
Riding experience okay
Looks: excellent
Performance: upto the mark
Servicing and maintenance: upto the mark in my city Rajahmundry
Pros: mileage and top speed as per promised
Cons: suspension on ghat roads.
On road price of the bike varies from vendor to vendor. I purchased the bike at Rajahmundry dealer for 85000 including RTO accessories and all.",PURE EV ETrance Neo,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,3
"Buying experience good, riding experience good, performance is average. Service is very poor. Worst suspension, it have faulty speedometer. Dealer is not ready to cooperate. For speedometer they are say it takes 15 days to repair. It must be replaced, but they denied for replacement. If it is like that we may not expect good service in future. Rear suspension is too much delicate, worst in experience.",PURE EV ETrance Neo,NA,NA,2,NA,NA,NA,NA,1
"Changed review after 1000 km. Range is better than any other e scooter in this price segment. Get 105+ range in eco mode. Got true range 96 km range in second mode. With pillion it will reduce it to 90 km. Brakes are too good. Showroom people were very helpful.
Improvement-
1)Instrument console is clear but battery indicator could have shown in percentage for accurate batter indication.
2) seat could be more spacious.",PURE EV ETrance Neo,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
"ETrance Neo is the best economical electric scooter in India. Pure lithium battery is awesome. Smooth riding.
Pros :
Best range (I got 140 km in 1st mode)
Best pickup more than other petrol vehicles in this range
Best Ev scooter
Cons :
Tyre should be 12 inches
Battery case should more better
Boot space should be more",PURE EV ETrance Neo,NA,NA,5,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Showroom staffs are good and helpful. It was very smooth buying.
Pros-
1)Good range - got more than 95km every time in 2 and 3 mode.
2) Good battery indicator
3) Brakes are really smooth.
4) Tires are of good quality.
Cons-
1) Size of scooty is very small. Even if the pillion is thin still it will be little uncomfortable.
2) This scooty is good for people of height 5'6"" or less. Above this people will have issue in smooth turning. You need to bring out your legs outside to turn.
3) Suspensions have issues. I started getting sounds when it goes through speed breakers hoping my 1st service will fix it.
I have ridden this scooty for just 600 km. Based upon which I gave this review. Please don't think to buy this scooty and ride your fat Indian mom, your mom won't fit in that space.",PURE EV ETrance Neo,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,3

I bought this vehicle after waiting for 3 month.. And this is very worth and i am happy to buy this vehicle as i was in dilemma that weather to buy this vehicle or not because of new launch... I was about to buy hero electric but thought to try a new this time and go for pure finally.... Hearing of 3 months notice period I was about to cancel but still will all other electric vehicle I convinced to pure company and thought to wait and after waiting for 3 months I finally got my vehicle with super look and comfort ride.... I wanted to check the mileage so firstly i charged 100% and took a ride... I thought it will give 90km but surprisingly it gave 120km exactly for 100% charge... And m very happy too buy and suggest the viewers to go for pure and go green.... Just loved it,PURE EV ETrance Neo,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"I just brought this bike 2 days ago Its awesome. Range is approximately 120km and the shock absorbers would be better.. But overall bike is good for 20-30 km long on single side journey.
Pick up is nice..
Tyre size should be 12""
Service could be better
Seat size is ample..
3 people are comfortable..",PURE EV ETrance Neo,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
"I bought this scooter in Feb. 2021, I tried many other manufacturer scooters but found ev ETrance neo is economically reasonable. For daily 30 to 40 km commuters this is good vehicle. This has 3 modes, 1st mode you cannot use it as the max speed is very less. We can use average and max speed modes only. In average speed (45km/h) i have got 100 to 105km range (max load was 90kg). If you use only max speed (60km/h), you will get maximum 80km range per charge.
I drove this scooter in heavy rain also and not faced any battery issues. Boot space is not there in my scooter and even cant keep its charger also. But this issue is resolved in recent edition of this scooter.
For one charge it takes 3 units of power and 4 hours time.
Not good for youths who likes speed. Good for people who likes economic ride.
Suspension is good but not for committed 150kg load.
Water enters switches which affects indicator and head light on/off function.
Odometer reading has difference compared to google map or any other bike or actual distance. Service person told that is because during short ride (anything less than 1km) km will not be added to total km count. Anything more than 1 km will be recorded to main km count. That's true but we will not go that short drives more often.
Over all I liked this bike and suggest others to buy.
Important suggestion: charge the battery only when it drains to at least 70 to 80% and charge 100 percent every time to get better battery life.",PURE EV ETrance Neo,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,4
"Brought recently, have raided around 200 kms no major issues . Bike Suspension needs to be improved . Build Quality is excellent. Comfortable for daily use

Easy to charge the battery .
It takes around 4 hours for full charge",PURE EV ETrance Neo,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5
"Scooty is ok if you are not planning for the long term(more than 3 yrs). Parts look very cheap, also u can remove the suspension because shockers are of no use.

Very comfortable to ride the bike at least you will be the tension free.Now talking about the pro:-1) no worry about rising petrol price.2) no worry about maintenance of engine like petrol engine.3) accurate meter 4) 0/km effectively saying 5) pollution and noise free operation Cons:-1) not good if your riding distance is above 100 km 2) you need to change the battery after 3-4 years ( approx 30000)3) charging time is about 2-3 hours.,Okinawa Ridge Plus,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

The times it displayed the speed, there was more than.20% inaccuracy. It showed 35kmph when it reality it struggled to generate 25kmph in eco mode. The battery sensor didn't work so it showed 5 bars even when the battery had completely drained. On top of it, on the best of roads it gave only 50kms per charge. They claim 120km per charge.

Okinawa has given a maximum speed of 55 kmph which was not met till date. the bike is showing 49 kmph as odometer reading, but was actually going at a speed of 39 kmph, which is really cheating.

"I am test driving most electric scooters and am looking at actual drive comfort. I am a father of two: 9 and 5. I am looking to replace my daily commute scooter and need to haul kids to and from school.Here is my feedback:1) height and leg space for a rider who is almost 6 ft is ok. Can manage.2) if your kids have large backpacks then it is difficult to manage it.3) basic side accessories like ladies side handle with hook cannot be fitted without interference with battery. I do not know where to hang two lunch bags.4) not enough space in the bike to hang or store 2 kids helmet.5) pickup and speed with 2 adults was pretty good compared to other electric scooters 6) killer design issue for me: my son's shoe keeps bumping into the back of my right leg everytime i stop the bike in traffic. This is due to the design of the footrest. Effectively, i have dirty pants in the morning if this my commute vehicle. The dealer had no side footrest solution nor was he polite during the inquiry about a solution to this problem. I would have bought thus without second thought if i was in college or before having kids.Many may say that i need a car or get alternate transport for your kids but i am an average consumer and all these needs are met comfortably by other scooters.

"Personal review on my bike to help all e-bike buyers out there :I am driving ampere zeal from 23 september 2019, i risked buying ampere zeal between various marketing giants like okinawa, ather, revolt etc. I will post in most sites to reach as many as possible.Personally i have tested various bikes from okinawa, benelli, and ampere, hero in chennai. Reviews from other brands: 1. Okinawa praise series: pros: cool looks, more electricals, useful head lights, 75kmph speed, good build quality.Cons: customers review that the battery life cycle is too short and it doesn't give the mileage the company promises. reason is too heavy bike, which overloads the battery and stresses it leading to less charging cycle. (if u want okinawa wait for belt drive series like ather or revolt or yamaha so it won't stress the battery and live longer). other thing is bike and spares are too costly. (better go for ather) praise lithium battery is too costly so after three years u will throw the bike than replacing the battery.2. Okinawa ridge+: ridge and ampere zeal have matching specs and proper rivals.Pros: good electrical options than zeal (have reverse), usable head lamps, looks like usual honda dio bikes.Cons: the bike i drew dint go fast due to less charge, but i feared the battery quality like in praise. (but heavy) bikes are not enough in stock. Some reviews says company doesn't solve their customers issues and poor warranty claims. They are eager in manufacturing and sell new bike only. (suits to praise too) replacement parts takes long.3. Benelli: Pros: cheap Cons: looks like a toy electric bike, speed is less, they buy bikes from various manufacturers (Indian and chinese) and sell it in their name(like battree brand they sell under benle) spares will take too long to reach u. poor build quality, ( except battree model which is good but just looks odd check amazon)4. Ampere reo:Pros: cool looks, useful head lamps, best buy for the price (cheap), they look similar to zeal except in performance.Cons: less speed 25 or 40kmph, average build quality.5. Ather 450 and rv 400: (haven't test driven) pros: speed, pickup, and everything is best ,belt drive so battery and motor will last long.Cons: too costly bike, spares and battery we will get bugged by people for it's annoying looks. not available only registration is going on. buzzing sound. 6. Hero electrc: pros: cost effective, well known brand, Cons: average build quality, looks like crap in design (very poor looks), avearge battery quality.7. Ampere zeal:Reason for buying ampere zeal: ampere company is always true to their words, zeal looked like honda dio, company has best customer support, colors and stock always available no waiting. And mainly cheap for the price and specs. We can't drive bikes at 25kmph so i needed >50 kmph and decent mileage. It's coimbatore startup and acquired by greaves. Pros: good pick up, cool looks like commercial dio, it gives promised mileage 75km/charge at 55 kpmh speed. It gives >90 km mileage at low speeds. a cheapest bike compared to others with speed >50. simple to use, detachable battery. quality of battery and hub motor is good. less weight can drive very easy and take it in gaps of traffic very easy. spares are ready in 2 to 5 days. Cons: useless head lamp, average body plastic build quality (it will feel like a newbie designed its body), average harness and body quality, (my brake holder had poor cast iron received broken waiting still to be changed) less electrical options, charges time is 5 hours. (fast charging reduces battery life so it's good)Who can buy ampere zeal: e-bike have no exchange value, so if you are not ready to donate 1.5 lakhs to ather or okinawa or revolt but u also need speed+ performance+ battery quality choose zeal if you want a commercial looking e-bike go fort it.Note: upcoming models from hero, ampere, yamaha, bajaj are creating strong expectations. But u need to wait an year to buy them.",Ampere Zeal,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,4

"For online supermarket delivery business. Bought 2 zeal bikes on recommendation of a porter delivery guy who had been using it for a year. Bought it at rajajinagar, bangalore. Found out about it being owned by greaves cotton limited and made a lot of money buying shares of the company. The company is present across India and is a reliable company of more than 160 years. Yes you read that right 160. Now coming to bike, with rough use, not even serviced in last 6 months , I am fully satisfied with the bike. One has run 2500 kms, another 1700 kms. I have saved at least Rs. 4500. Now bike has started slowing a bit and that seems to be because of us not having it serviced properly. Petrol scooters now feel outdated to say the least when I tried my Jupiter or activa once in a while. We have always charged the bike by taking the battery (12 kgs) up to the second floor where we have our warehouse. Never had any issue with this. Planning to buy 2 more shortly. Happy customer :-) If there was one thing I would change in this vehicle it would. Be the headlights , they are not very effective. Rest all good and helped us save a ton of money and both bikes will be almost free in one year of usage. Let's see how the vehicle performs going forward but upto now it's been a super ride.

Very good service provided by wagon wheels. Pros: good looking, weight less, simple and good pickup. Cons: should handle very carefully because of its average body parts.

"After scratching my head and personally testing atleast 6 brands of ev finalized on ampere because, 1. Brand owned by greaves (indian) 2. Practical for delivering goods 3. Decent mileage 4. Nearby service centers.
I personally rode the bike for couple of days and it felt awesome riding a noiseless vehicle for the first time ever. Post that I assigned the vehicle to one of the delivery boys in my business.
The bike is made of fiber has metal guards all around - but the quality is cheaper that what we may come across other brands like tvs - Honda - hero etc. If we rate built quality of the established brands at 100 then zeal is at 60. The output of the bike has been bang on as stated by the dealer 60 km at high speed (max 54km / h) and 70km at low speed (max 27 km / h) with charging time of approx. 4 hours to full charge. Charge has a 5 amp plug so you can put it in the small sockets and get the charging going on.
The first service came within 10 days of the vehicle used (1000 kms), god knows what they do during this check up as there are hardly any parts they need to check except the battery and motor and the connectors between them. Now by the time the bike reached 1800 km it started stalling (not moving) and we faced this issue atleast 4 times. We had to push the vehicle to the center and the mechanic just tightened the connectors and the vehicle was working, as i write this review the vehicle is stalled for the 5th time and the service center is not replying to my problems. A mail has been sent to the company which has not been answered for past 5 days, the customer service is so pathetic that you loose your patience.
Apart from the mechanic no one in the whole chain - from dealer - customer service - sales - marketing know about the vehicle and so we speaking to anyone of these people is like speaking to a wall.
Plus: -
1. Budget vehicle (all incl. 70k on road in pune)
2. Decent range with decent charge time
3. Good warranty on motor and battery (3 years/30k km)
4. Good max speed for city riding
5. Low profile - so excellent for ladies and with ample foot space and boot space - so good for delivery agencies.
6. Keyless use of vehicle (controllable by remote - just like a car)
Minus:-
1. On - off noise is too loud
2. Built quality is average - can expect much more while paying 70k
3. Only noise coming from the vehicle is of the rattling of guards placed around the vehicle
4. Major fault - the distance between the left hand grip and indicator is so much that one needs to leave the grip to put on the indicator. (else you need a giant hand)
5. Recurring stalling issue - and no know how of it to anyone shows that the vehicle was launched in a rush, not keeping issues in mind. Mostly some wire is short / loose - but as no one knows how to repair it - its remains a big q for me too.
Happy that I bought a made in India vehicle, sad because is breaks down very often, hopeful because I stay in India and have faith that we will find a solution one day.",Ampere Zeal,NA,NA,4,NA,NA,NA,NA,3

It is giving the same problem now. I informed concerned person and he didn't turn up for 4dys.

"I would like to bring few issue in everybody notice that i bought nyx e-5 (registration no. Dl 9sb v7147) on 14th july 2019 from dwarka motors. I was very happy because i could save environment & money both.1. After three days lock below seat was not in working condition. When i put key to open the seat then it was moving all around. I was not able to charge the battery because charger was locked in seat. Somehow i managed to open the seat and charged the battery. Next days i went to workshop & he fixed the lock. Also he found some wires were burn near connector. He also fixed that issue on that day.2. After few days lock condition was again same. Also when i was riding the scooter on saturday evening then sound of scooter went high like sound of old buses when he use brakes. Sound was unbearable and scooter also run with lot of jerk. I called the workshop person and tell this issue. He denied to send his person but when i request him then he told that person will come next day but he will charge rs. 200 for visit. I had no option and i agree to pay rs. 200. Somehow i managed to bring scooter to workshop on sunday morning and workshop engineer found that wire was burn near connector which he fixed few days back. He changed the lock also. Also charger socket was also not working which he changed. I was totally frustrated as i wasted 3 hours.3. Same issue i faced after few days. Fortunately when i reached to workshop, two engineers was also there from hero electric and they assured me that this problem will not come again. I was too upset this time as i came 3 times in workshop with in one month.4. Now again i am feeling that brake is tight, some times sound of scooter is very high and i feel there is some issue in scooter again. It can be stop any time. 5. Also want to let you know that there is two more big problems in this scooter. It is very uncomfortable when ride. 1st issue is brake – it is too hard & looks like hero electric put cycle brakes in it. Always feel jerk when use brakes. The biggest drawback is it can’t be usable if you push break suddenly. If you are at the speed of 30-35 and use break suddenly then it will not work and you will get hurt badly. 2nd issue is shocker, looks like there is no shocker as we feel heavy jerk when it goes to broken road.6. They claim 50-60 kms in one charge but it can’t go above that 35-40 kms. You can’t compare this with another scooter because quality of this scooter is too low. I paid rs. 71k and feel i wasted my complete money after buying this. I would like to return this scooter to hero electric asap due to these issues.",Hero Electric NYX,NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,1

I purchased this scooter recently. Battery and motor power are good but the material used in this is next to worst. Plastic is same as used in children toys.

Ground clearance is less. If 1 person riding this scooter can easily give mileage to 60 or above ( got 68 km riding still 25% left) if two person is riding there must be some changes it will give around 50-55. It consumes 1.36 kwh or 1.36 unit of electricity from 0-100%. I am spending 35 inr for my daily commute in my town.

Everything is ok. And I greatly appreciate Hyundai's innovation in bringing electric cars but the price for this is too much and even if the gst gets reduced it will come about 20l but there are many competitors in that range except for the electric transmission. To be successful in Indian market they should 1.Reduce the price 2.implement more electric stations around major cities 3.service should be improved incase for electric cars 4.free service should be given for at least 8 times Anyway hatsoff for Hyundai for their innovative electric car in Indian roads,hyundai kona,NA,NA,Did a short drive once,NA,NA,NA,NA,2

Hyundai Kona Electric is extremely good car but expensive for its size and performance. We should wait for reduction in GST and road tax which is likely to reduce the price by couple of lakh rupees.

So the future of Indian cars have arrived! Hyundai certainly has heated up the competition in EV segment too now...As currently the Kona Electric is completely build unit that's why the initial cost is looking a bit high because of import tax etc..I hope that it gets upto 20 lakhs after complete manufacturing in India!

"I chose the base model, i.e., the XM variant. The car got delivered on time. In fact initially I was appraised of a waiting period of 3 months but eventually the car got delivered within 15 days only. Driving this car is as as easy as it could get. It is really smooth, noise and vibration free car. Range anxiety will be there for now, until proper infra is developed. However once one get habituated with the required driving style, i.e., feather touch with accelerator and brakes and properly using the regeneration, then this car can give mileage as high as 280km in the winter. In the summer the range drops significantly, in my case to 220-230km. Charging time is quite annoying and if someone is not having proper wiring and at least 4kw meter connection at their household, they must do it before purchasing the car. Overall the car is comfortable, rear seat and leg space quite decent, however the slight bulge at the middle of the back seat base could have been avoided. Few features like anti-glare mirror, speed sensing lock, electric ORVM, rear wiper and camera could have been added considering it to be a high value car. Although these are available in the higher variants. Also the interior could have been a bit modern. Conclusion: if your max requirement is city drive and that too at least 50-60km per day on an average, then this is the best car for you. On the other hand if you love to go for long drives then time hasn't arrived yet to switch onto electric.",tata nexon ev,NA,NA,Few thousand kilometers,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

Haven't faced any issues. It gives me a range of 200-220 km on full AC. If i use it in city and highways I get a range of 170-180 km if used strictly in city and small lanes with average speed not going above 30kms.with full AC in May in Mumbai. so its a great car.

"I bought Nexon EV 2 months ago. I was always interested in electric cars therefore after examining various product and waiting after launch of each one to judge the response, we finally decided to go ""vocal for local"" and buy Nexon EV. Other rivals are better in terms of all aspects but it doesn't make any sense to buy them because though they have cheaper running cost as every electric it costs the same as buying ICE car of same segment and spending on maintenance and fuel. On the other hand Nexon offers value for money package with decent features. Approximate range according to my driving with AC ,music system etc always switched on. 1. City : 200-220 km 2. Highway: 160-175km Pros : 1. It is a good looking car and has superior build quality. I had an accident and I did not use my insurance, vehicle was in good condition on the other hand opponent's car got crushed and had to tow his vehicle. 2. Has superb ride quality and insulation. Very peaceful to drive. Has more than enough ground clearance. 3. Interior quality is up to the mark and seats are extremely comfortable. 4.Performance is superb ,sports mode is addictive for torque lovers. 5.It is a perfect primary vehicle if you have secondary vehicle. 6. It has low running cost(1-1.5 Rs/km) and no dependency of fuel station. 7.Connected features offered gives peace of mind. Cons: 1. It can't be only car to own due to under developing charging infrastructure and insufficient range. 2. Range is not sufficient for long runs more than 160 km even if you have fast charger on the way as time spend on charging is too much. Eg (Pune- Kolhapur). 3. Infotainment system is a bit laggy, reverse camera and overall resolution of screen is not as good as other brands. 4. Due to extreme torque on offer wheel spin may eat your tyres early. Lack of much needed traction control system is evident.",tata nexon ev,NA,NA,Few thousand kilometers,NA,NA,NA,NA,5

A good car but overpriced a little. The starting price at 11 L would have been better for customers. Though features and mileage looks good for city drive. What gives us fear is the Tata zconnect app subscription which may be free for only one year.
